Police said the identity of the dead person would not be released until an autopsy had been performed on Friday.According to Detective Steve Adair, police received multiple calls just after 5am on 1 January reporting shots fired. He says that by the time officers arrived, the suspect or suspects had already left. The police do not yet know how many suspects were involved, or what their motive might have been. There were more than 50 people at the party. Police found five people in and around the house with gunshot wounds. Adair says two others later showed up at hospitals for treatment, one of whom later died. The other victim remains in hospital in critical condition. The incident is the second mass shooting to occur in Canada inside a week. Nine people, including the suspected gunman, were found dead at three crime scenes in and around Edmonton on Tuesday.",Thu 1 Jan 2015 23.11 GMT,"['Canada', 'Americas', 'Gun crime', 'news']"

He was remanded in custody for a further week on Tuesday.“Opposition parties that peacefully voice criticism of the government play a vital role in inclusive, pluralistic states and societies,” the State Department said in a statement on Wednesday.“We are concerned that this action against a senior leader of the opposition will only inflame tensions,” it said.The United Nations human rights office in Geneva earlier said it was concerned that a potentially lengthy prison sentence could be handed to Sheikh Salman.Sheikh Ali Salman is head of the al-Wefaq Islamic Society. Al-Wefaq did not take part in the November and says voting districts favoured the kingdom’s Sunni Muslims.  Photograph: Mazen Mahdi/European Pressphoto AgencyA statement issued by Bahrain’s Public Prosecution on Thursday said Sheikh Salman was being interrogated on charges that include spreading ideas to defy the regime and authorities.It said he had been confronted by recordings of a speech he gave to the general conference of the Wefaq party and a television interview in which he said that the opposition in Bahrain had received offers to emulate the Syrian opposition and take up arms, which it had refused.He is still being questioned in the presence of lawyers and the public prosecution has allowed family members to visit him in detention, the statement said.Bahrain, whose government has close relations with the US and Britain, has been gripped by tension since 2011 protests led by majority Shi’ite Muslims demanding reforms and a bigger role in running the Sunni-led country.Al-Wefaq did not take part in the November poll, saying that parliament would not have enough power and that voting districts favoured the kingdom’s Sunni Muslims.Separately, a Bahraini court on Wednesday sentenced prominent human rights activist Mohammed al-Maskati to six months in jail on charges of taking part in an illegal gathering in 2012, his lawyer said.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/01/norman-atlantic-ferry-fire-missing-greece-italy-estimates,Widely different estimates of those still missing after Adriatic Sea ferry fire,"Italy believes 98 people may remain unaccounted for after Norman Atlantic disaster, but Greece claims only 18 are missing","Greece and Italy have issued widely different figures for how many people are still not accounted for in the ferry fire that killed at least 11 people in the Adriatic Sea.The numbers ranged from as many as 98, according to the Italian prosecutor Giuseppe Volpe, to 18, according to the Greek merchant marine ministry. Greece says Italy’s list is full of duplications and misspellings but the discrepancy could not be immediately explained since the prosecutor’s office was closed for the New Year holiday.A tug began towing the fire-ravaged ferry across wind-whipped seas toward Italy on Thursday afternoon.Giuseppe Barretta, the owner of the tug boat company, told the Associated Press in the Adriatic port of Brindisi that the operation had started near the coast of Albania, where the Norman Atlantic ferry had been stranded after Sunday’s pre-dawn fire. He estimated the towing could take 15 hours, depending on weather.Earlier, the Italian coastguard said waves in the region were as high as five metres (16ft) and winds were blowing at more than 40 knots (46mph).Once the ferry arrives in Brindisi, Italian authorities will inspect its interior for any possible other bodies.Floriana Segreto of the Italian coastguard said a total of 477 people had been rescued from the stricken ferry. That figure, plus the 11 dead, would mean at least 488 people had been on board as it sailed from Greece to Italy.Greek officials said 474 people were officially on the ferry – leading to questions about Italy’s tally or suggestions that the ferry had also been carrying an unknown number of unregistered migrants.Italy says it rescued or discovered 170,000 migrants and asylum seekers at sea last year as they tried to slip into Europe.",Thu 1 Jan 2015 18.32 GMT,"['Greece', 'Water transport', 'Europe', 'Italy', 'Albania', 'news']"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/01/new-years-eve-stampede-shanghai,New Year’s Eve stampede leaves shock and confusion in Shanghai,Witnesses give conflicting views on cause of chaos after at least 36 people are crushed to death,"Little Huang could not imagine a better place to bring in 2015 than Shanghai’s Bund riverfront, where he could stand amid restored 1920s art-deco buildings and watch an elaborate laser-light show illuminate the sky. He arrived at about 8.30pm on New Year’s Eve with three friends, when the crowds were still thin. They staked out a position on an elevated viewing platform near Chen Yi Square, where they could gaze across the dark Huangpu river at the bright skyscrapers of Pudong district, China’s most impressive skyline.Huang couldn’t have known that three hours later, he would witness one of Shanghai’s worst disasters in recent years: a stampede on the viewing platform steps that would leave at least 36 people dead and 47 injured. Photographs on social networking sites would show bystanders attempting to resuscitate supine bodies. Hospitals throughout the city would fill with patients as their relatives sobbed in overcrowded waiting rooms, desperate for shreds of information.Early on Thursday, state media offered conflicting accounts of what had caused the stampede. One witness said the chaos began after flurries of fake money descended from a nearby building, when some people fell over while scrambling to pick up the bills and the crowd panicked. Later, videos and witness accounts suggested the platform was simply too crowded, and became a death trap under the weight of the crowd.Witnesses said the mayhem centred on a stairway leading up to a viewing platform overlooking the river. Some people were trying to climb to the platform as others tried to get down, causing panic and mass confusion.The dead include 25 females and 10 males, most of them students and young people in their 20s, according to Xinhua, the state news agency. The youngest was 16. At least 13 of the injured are in a critical condition and others said to be experiencing psychological trauma.“We were caught in the middle and saw some girls falling while screaming,” a witness surnamed Yin told Xinhua. “Then people started to fall down, row by row.”Soon after Huang, a first-year foreign languages student, arrived on the viewing platform he and his three friends began to feel the chill. They left their prized spot to shelter from the wind behind a public toilet in Chen Yi Square below and watched over the next 40 minutes as the crowd grew denser.Police closed off an entrance to the platform, making it difficult to return. “The police didn’t have a very good attitude,” Huang told the news portal Sina. “They were pushing people’s heads.” Some people became frustrated, and began to push against the barrier; a small group of middle-aged men sneaked past the guards and on to the platform.Huang and his friends eventually returned to the viewing platform, but they had lost their earlier vantage point. Soon, Huang began to feel a creeping sense of unease. People at the back of the platform were trying to push their way to the front, but the crowd wouldn’t yield.“I grabbed a classmate, and there was no way to stand still – we were pushed every 10 minutes,” he told Sina. “When I looked back I saw the older men shouting.” People at the front began to get angry. They shouted back: “Stop squeezing us, if you want to be in front, you have to come earlier – you’re in the back, which means you came late.” But the pushing only intensified. Someone shouted that a couple of the older men had knives. The crowd’s anxiety turned to fear.“At that moment, we didn’t feel right – like we didn’t want to be here,” Huang told Sina. At about 40 minutes to midnight, he felt he needed to escape. People on the platform began to push towards the stairs, as others attempted to enter the viewing platform through the exits, creating a bottleneck. Huang couldn’t move. People struggled, and some fell. From below, he heard screams and the sounds of crying.A video posted online shows dense crowds pushing to get down a low staircase, causing some people at the front to topple under the weight of the crowd. At 11.40pm, the crowd began to chant “fall back”, which appeared to momentarily ease the crush and the panic.“People were screaming, women were screaming and people starting jumping off the staircase to get clear,” a Shanghai resident named Sarah said. “There was a quiet, and then people on the stairs fell in a wave and people started to get trampled.”By 11.55pm, enough people had cleared away from the staircase to reveal those lying on the ground amid scattered rubbish – shoes, hats, an array of glowing plastic new year souvenirs.Pictures and videos show chaotic scenes in the wake of the stampede: crowds packed against police lines, long rows of ambulances, medical workers treating people who lay on the ground.At one hospital where the injured were being treated, waiting relatives crowded round to look as police held up photographs of unidentified bodies. On recognising one of the dead, young women began crying.The stampede was the worst disaster in Shanghai since 2010, when a high-rise apartment fire left 58 people dead.Most large gatherings in China are carefully controlled by authorities but the country has seen other incidents in which overcrowding has been fatal. Last year, 14 people – some of them children – were killed and 10 injured in a stampede that broke out as food was being distributed at a mosque in Ningxia region. Also last year, six students were killed in a stampede at a primary school in Kunming city in the south-west after the accidental blocking of a stairway corridor.The president, Xi Jinping, has urged Shanghai authorities to “do everything in their power” to find the cause of the Shanghai disaster, and the city’s Communist party secretary, Han Zheng, has formed a working group to lead the investigation.On Thursday, a page about the stampede on China’s most popular microblogging site, Sina Weibo, attracted more than 290m views. Many people wondered how such scenes could unfold in China’s most developed and cosmopolitan city.",Thu 1 Jan 2015 18.30 GMT,"['China', 'New year', 'Asia Pacific', 'news']"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/02/iran-us-tentative-deal-nuclear-programme-uranium-russia,Iran and US tentatively agree on formula to reduce nuclear programme,"Washington hopes Tehran will ship enriched uranium to Russia to reduce its weapon-making ability, diplomats say","Iran and the United States have tentatively agreed on a formula that Washington hopes will reduce Tehran’s ability to make nuclear arms by committing it to ship to Russia much of the material needed for such weapons, diplomats say.In another sign of progress, two diplomats told Associated Press that negotiators at the December round of nuclear talks drew up for the first time a catalogue outlining areas of potential accord and differing approaches to remaining disputes.The diplomats said differences still dominate ahead of the next round of Iran six-power talks on 15 January in Geneva. But they suggested that even agreement to create a to-do list would have been difficult previously because of wide gaps between the sides.Iran denies it wants nuclear arms, but it is negotiating with the US, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany on cuts to its atomic programme in the hope of ending crippling sanctions. The talks have been extended twice due to stubborn disagreements.The main conflict is over uranium enrichment, which can create both reactor fuel and the fissile core of nuclear arms.In seeking to reduce Iran’s bomb-making ability, the US has proposed that Tehran export much of its stockpile of enriched uranium – something the Islamic Republic has long said it would not do.The diplomats said both sides in the talks are still arguing about how much of an enriched uranium stockpile to leave Iran. It now has enough for several bombs, and Washington wants substantial cuts below that level.But the diplomats said the newly created catalogue lists shipping out much of the material as tentatively agreed upon.The diplomats, who are familiar with the talks, spoke to the AP recently and demanded anonymity because they are not authorised to comment on the closed negotiations.Issues that still need agreement, they said, include the size of Iran’s future enrichment output. The US insists that it be cut in half, leaving Tehran with about 4,500 centrifuges used to enrich uranium, or fewer if it replaces them with advanced models. Tehran is ready for a reduction of only about 20%, according to the diplomats.Two other unresolved issues are Iran’s Fordo underground enrichment site and the nearly built Arak nuclear reactor. The US and its five allies in the talks want to repurpose Fordo to a non-enrichment function because it is believed impervious to a military attack from the air.The six also seek to re-engineer Arak from a model that produces enough plutonium for several nuclear weapons a year to a less proliferation-prone model.Negotiators hope to reach a rough deal by March and a final agreement by 30 June.",Fri 2 Jan 2015 20.39 GMT,"['Iran', 'Middle East and north Africa', 'China', 'Asia Pacific', 'Germany', 'France', 'Nuclear weapons', 'news']"

She has been studying life in rural India for some time, Singh said.A Kolkata-based tourist guide had taken the Japanese woman to Bodh Gaya to show her the Buddhist pilgrimage centre where Gautama Buddha is said to have obtained enlightenment under a tree. He was joined by four others in keeping her in captivity and raping her, police said.Two of the arrests were made in the area on Friday and one took place earlier this week in Kolkata, police added.India has a long history of tolerance of sexual violence, but a series of high-profile rape cases have triggered strong public outrage in recent years, leading to tougher anti-rape laws.India has doubled prison terms for rapists to 20 years and criminalised voyeurism, stalking and the trafficking of women.The law also makes it a crime for police officers to refuse to open cases when complaints are made.",Fri 2 Jan 2015 20.20 GMT,"['India', 'Japan', 'Rape and sexual assault', 'news']"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/02/smugglers-abandon-migrant-ship-italy-ezadeen,Smugglers abandon migrant ship off Italy in new tactic to force rescue,"Watchdog says smugglers ‘playing chicken with people’s lives’ after Ezadeen, carrying 450, found adrift in dangerous seas","A “ghost ship” carrying hundreds of migrants was abandoned on Friday by its crew of smugglers in dangerous seas off the coast of southern Italy, in a move that a spokesman for the International Organisation for Migration said “takes the smuggling game to a whole new level”.The cargo ship Ezadeen, which set sail under a Sierra Leone flag from a Turkish port this week, was discovered drifting without a captain 40 nautical miles from the Italian coast. Italian coastguards were forced to intervene to prevent a disaster and possibly save the lives of the estimated 450 people on board, many of them thought to be Syrian refugees.“We are alone and we have no one to help us,” a migrant woman told officials by radio after the ship was asked to identify itself, coastguard spokesman Filippo Marini told an Italian radio station. Footage showed Italian officers landing on the Ezadeen by helicopter, before the ship was towed to Italy.The Ezadeen was the second vessel in four days to be found sailing without a crew. Earlier in the week, 800 migrants on the Blue Sky M, a Moldovan-registered ship, were rescued by Italian coastguards when it was discovered sailing without an active crew five miles off the coast.The two incidents have left observers of migrant routes in the Mediterranean fearing that people-smugglers have found a new and ruthless way of working in the area despite a recent decision to scale back Italian rescue operations.“It’s an extraordinary way to treat people,” said Leonard Doyle, a spokesman for the IOM, a UN-linked body that focuses on migrants. “The abandonment of ships in the high seas is a very dangerous thing to do at the best of times and takes the smuggling game to a whole new level that we’ve never seen before.”The tactic shows that despite the cancellation last autumn of Operation Mare Nostrum – an Italian-run rescue scheme that European authorities feared was a prominent reason why migrants were risking all to reach Europe – smugglers are still finding ways to get close to the Italian shore and force coastguards to rescue their passengers.Under the new system, ships carrying illegal migrants are supposed to be intercepted by a pan-European maritime border agency and prevented from reaching Italian waters. But Doyle said smugglers were now presenting their ships as legal entities until they were within a few miles of Italy. Then they disembarked, forcing the Italian authorities to intervene in order to save lives.“It’s almost as if [the smugglers] are playing chicken with the lives of vulnerable people – men, women and children who are fleeing war – and seeing who blinks first,” said Doyle. “But they know full well that the Italian coastguards will have to intervene.”An Egyptian ship owner involved in the smuggling business told the Guardian that his associates used similar tactics, and often left their ships in the hands of untrained charges “who don’t know how to sail”.“They only have GPS,” said the ship owner, who asked to be known as Abu Khaled, from a port on Egypt’s north coast. “Someone else starts the motor for them – and they follow the direction on the GPS device. So the driver doesn’t have any more sailing knowledge than this. He just follows the arrow. The GPS is the captain. If the waves become higher, they don’t know how to deal with it – so they just keep on going.”Some European politicians believe the answer is to create an even bigger deterrent than the cancellation of Mare Nostrum. Claude Moraes, a British MEP, told the BBC that its replacement scheme, Triton, “scares no one”, and he called for a new scheme that could be given the backing of a national judicial system.But others believe that little will deter the hundreds of thousands of migrants seeking to escape war and hardship in the Middle East. “Why do we keep going by sea?” asked Ahmed, a Syrian arrested while attempting to cross the Mediterranean from Egypt this autumn. “Because we trust God’s mercy more than the mercy of people here.”Doyle said it had been thought that the Mare Nostrum was “a pull factor, attracting migrants, and that by ending it migrants would stay on the other side of the Med. What we’re seeing is that whether or not there was a pull factor, people are still coming. There is still a demand from people who are desperately fleeing the Syrian war and who are looking for ways to be rescued and taken ashore safely.”The recent activity of the stricken Ezadeen appears to shine a light on the demand for smuggling, even in the stormier winter months. Records show that the ship departed from Tartus, Syria’s second largest port, in October before sailing north towards Turkey. Then it sharply looped back south towards Cyprus.After sailing towards the port of Famagusta, in northern Cyprus, it then sailed north once again towards the Turkey coast before zig-zagging in an area of open water between Turkey and Cyprus.Over the past week and a half it skirted westwards along Turkey’s Mediterranean coast, according to records provided by Astra Paging, which provides software that tracks vessels using signals broadcast from vessels.The ship continued in a western direction to the north of Crete, changed direction and heading northwards along the coast of Greece before ending up drifting across towards Italy, where it appears to have been abandoned.",Fri 2 Jan 2015 18.59 GMT,"['Migration', 'Italy', 'Europe', 'Water transport', 'news']"

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/03/china-tiger-farms-wildlife-trade,Chinese demand for tiger wine and skins puts wild cats in peril,Conservationists concerned as tiger farming industry removes stigma of buying status symbols and boosts illegal trade,"To the thump of dance music, four tigers roll over in succession, and then raise themselves up on to their haunches. A man in a shiny blue shirt waves a metal stick at them, and they lift their front paws to beg.The “show” takes place twice a day in a gloomy 1,000-seat auditorium – empty on a recent afternoon except for one Chinese tourist, two reporters and a security guard, its broken seats and cracked spotlights painting a picture of neglect.Outside, hundreds of tigers pace back and forth in small, scrubby enclosures or lie listlessly in much smaller, concrete and rusted metal cages. An occasional plaintive growl rends the air.This is the Xiongshen Tiger and Bear Mountain Village in the southern Chinese city of Guilin, one of the country’s biggest tiger farms. It is part of a booming industry that is threatening to drive this magnificent animal toward extinction in the wild, conservationists say, by fuelling demand for “luxury” tiger parts.Encouraged by the tiger farming industry, China’s wealthy are rediscovering a taste for tiger bone wine – promoted as a treatment for rheumatism and impotence – as well as tiger skin rugs and stuffed animals, sought after as status symbols among an elite obsessed with conspicuous consumption.That trend, in turn, is only making tiger poaching more lucrative across Asia – because wild tigers are still cheaper to kill and smuggle across borders than captive bred ones and often preferred by consumers. Farming has removed any stigma from tiger products and undermined global efforts to stamp out the illegal trade.“The argument put forward by the tiger-farming lobby is that farmed tiger products will flood the market, relieving pressure on wild tigers,” said Debbie Banks of the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), an international campaigning organisation. “This is a ridiculous notion and has turned into a disastrous experiment.”Tigers numbers globally may have stabilised in recent years, yet they are still perilously low, and wild tigers are still dying in record numbers in India, their main habitat, with many killed by poachers to satisfy demand from China.The next two years could be crucial, environmentalists say. With calls for change increasing both within the country and outside, China is reviewing its 25-year-old wildlife law and asking itself: will it stand on the side of its domestic tiger-farming lobby or will it stand on the side of wild tigers and global public opinion?Under global pressure, China banned trade in tiger bone and rhino horn in 1993, while traditional Chinese medicine practitioners also removed the products from their pharmacopeia, moves that conservationists says cut demand and helped stabilise the population of Siberian tigers in north Asia.But by then, China’s tiger-farming industry was already beginning to take off. The private Xiongshen farm was established in 1993, by a former duck and snake breeder, Zhou Weisen, with investment from the State Forestry Administration (SFA); its main competitor is a state-run farm in the northern province of Heilongjiang, set up in 1986.Tigers are easy to breed in captivity, and their numbers went from a handful to a few hundred and then thousands. Today, there are thought to be between 5,000 and 6,000 tigers on about 200 farms in China, mostly born into captivity and many kept in appalling conditions – compared to less than 4,000 of the animals left in the wild. Among them are Siberian (or Amur), South China and Bengal tigers.Ever since establishing the farms, Chinese wildlife officials have been campaigning for international approval to lift the ban on tiger bone use, arguing that the country has a right to use its “domestic natural resources” as it sees fit, and that tiger bone wine – rice wine in which bones from the big cats have been soaking – is medically effective and part of Chinese culture. They contend that the trade could be regulated effectively to reduce the demand for wild tiger parts.But even as the rest of the world disagrees, it appears that China has gone ahead anyway. Multiple probes by the EIA and International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) over the past decade, together with The Washington Post’s own investigation, show the tiger bone wine industry has boomed, with support from the SFA.“After these farms started selling wine, and taxidermists started selling tiger pelts, it really stimulated waning demand from consumers,” said Grace Ge Gabriel of the IFAW.Xiongshen alone says it houses more than 1,000 tigers – although fewer than 200 are available for tourists to view – and 500 bears, legally farmed to extract their bile for a different wine.It presents itself as a tourist destination, but its bleak animal enclosures and show – where bears also twirl hula hoops around their necks and cycle unsteadily across uneven floorboards, while a goat balances nervously on a high beam with a monkey on its back – barely attract an audience.In a building on the compound, the farm’s real money-spinner is on sale – bottles of wine, in the shape of tigers, listing as a main ingredient the bones of “precious animals”, and of African lions. Even the name on the bottle – “tonic bone wine” – uses a Chinese character that rhymes with the word for tiger. Everything is designed to tell consumers this is tiger bone wine, without explicitly saying so. Even the park admission tickets boast of government approval to make wine from “the skeletons of animals which have died of natural causes” to support the tiger breeding programme.Across town, retailers are more open, boasting that the tiger-shaped bottles do indeed contain wine in which tiger bones have been steeped. A bottle left to mature for three years sells for the equivalent of $80, six years for $155, while a vintage eight-year wine retails for $290.In 2006, an IFAW investigator gained access to the farm’s winery in the town of Pingnan, where the manager showed off 400 wine vats, boasting that each contained a tiger skeleton; one vat, he said, was reserved exclusively for consumption by a senior local official.Zhou’s office said he declined to be interviewed for this report.At the state-run farm in Heilongjiang, tourism is mixed with conservation as the public rationale for keeping another 1,000 captive-bred tigers. Chief engineer Liu Dan said the long-term goal was to reintroduce animals back into the wild but said it could take generations of tigers before any were ready.In recent months, two Siberian tigers reintroduced into the wild by Russian President Vladimir Putin crossed into China and caused havoc, killing goats, chickens and even a pet dog before returning home.Conservationists say China’s captive bred tigers would be even more of a hazard: accustomed to people and used to eating livestock, they would head straight for villages, where they would kill or be killed. Cross-breeding also means the animals have no value in preserving the gene pool of wild tiger species. But Liu rejects that criticism, as well as the wider critique of the farming industry that he says comes from “NGOs and foreign groups”.“They want to ruin the image of China’s government and crack down on traditional Chinese medicine,” he said. “Some of them are funded by foreign medical syndicates.”Bottles of “Bone Invigoration Liquor” on display at the gift shop of the Heilongjiang Siberian Tiger Park in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China.  Photograph: Qilai Shen/Washington PostToday, bottles of “bone invigoration liquor”, with a picture of a tiger on the front, are openly sold on the premises, with sales staff telling visitors it is made with the bones of tigers that had died of natural causes.If true, that would be a direct contravention of China’s own law and against the spirit of a 2007 decision under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) that tigers should not be bred for trade in their parts.But if the prospect of turning tigers into wine appals many animal lovers, it is the trade in tiger pelts that is even riskier for the world’s remaining wild animals. Across China, taxidermists offer tiger skin rugs or stuffed animals in a variety of poses – such as climbing a mountain – complete with permits from the SFA.Skins from captive bred tigers helped perpetuate “the desirability and prestige of decorating your home with a tiger skin rug,” said Banks of the EIA. That in turn helped encourage poaching, because the costs of raising captive tigers and of “wining and dining local bureaucracy to secure licenses” makes them more expensive than wild ones, she said.Presented with evidence of the tiger skin trade [PDF] at a Cites meeting in July, Chinese officials admitted for the first time that their government was indeed licensing the sale of pelts, according to participants.But even more grisly than the trade in skins was a report from Leizhou in southern China in March that police had busted a gang who would slaughter tigers in front of a paying audience of local officials and businessmen.At least 10 were killed on separate occasions, according to police. They would then be sold for parts and meat, a prized delicacy at some banquets. The butcher, a man named Huang who had learned his trade slaughtering pigs, was reported to have died in an accident while trying to escape arrest.But while some arrests are taking place, the political will to end tiger smuggling is patchy at best. Between 2005 and 2012, the EIA says it has supplied the Chinese government with evidence of its meetings with several traders involved in the trans-Himalayan smuggling of big cat skins, in the hope that police would start their own investigations. “The individuals we met are still in operation,” Banks said.At the Cites meeting in July, a working group was established to look into ending the tiger trade, with China in the chair. But pressure for change is also mounting at home as part of a review of China’s wildlife law, which promotes the domestication and breeding of wildlife and the “utilisation of wildlife resources”.Conservationists have been lobbying hard for a change in emphasis, away from utilisation and toward conservation of habitats and of animals in the wild, but they face significant opposition from a wealthy and powerful tiger-farming lobby, said Mang Ping, a professor specialising in ecological ethics at the Central Institute of Socialist Studies in Beijing.In December, reports emerged that the new law will stress the importance of animal welfare. That might be good news for animals kept in zoos and farms, said Mang, but not if it is “used as an excuse for using and breeding wildlife”.What is needed, conservationists say, is a clear government decision to outlaw the trade in tiger parts – backed up by enforcement and education. Otherwise, they say, these big cats may ultimately be reduced one day to the status of farm animals.There is also some hope that President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on corruption could benefit tigers, just as it has already thrown a lifeline to the world’s sharks. In 2013, the government outlawed shark fin soup at official banquets as part of an effort to curb lavish displays of wealth and consumption.Like ivory products, tiger skins and tiger bone wine are often presented to officials as bribes. Several pelts were reported to be among a huge haul of luxury goods seized when former lieutenant general Gu Junshan was charged with corruption and abuse of power in March, for example.In 2010, at an International Tiger Forum in St Petersburg, then-premier Wen Jiabao joined other world leaders in promising to end the tiger trade but failed to follow through. The hope now is that Xi will be more decisive and more effective.“I firmly believe he knows the risk to China’s reputation,” said Gabriel of the IFAW. “This is not contributing to China’s economy at all; it just contributes to China having a bad name.”Xu Jing contributed to this reportThis article appeared in the Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from the Washington Post",Sat 3 Jan 2015 23.00 GMT,"['Animals', 'Animal welfare', 'China', 'Asia Pacific', 'Wildlife', 'Illegal wildlife trade', 'Conservation', 'features']"

The photojournalist presents the documentary-style clip in English, claiming that “life in Mosul is business as usual” and that media reports suggesting the city is “depressed” and “living in fear” are “misleading”.The country’s second largest city was captured by Isis militants during a blitz in June during which they murdered more than 2,000 Shia prisoners and soldiers, according to Human Rights Watch.The eight-minute video, which sees 43-year-old Cantlie visit a market, a hospital and a police station, purports to paint life in the bomb-hit city as stable.A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: “We are aware of the release of another video and are studying its contents.”In the video, Cantlie tells the camera: “The media likes to paint a picture of life in the Islamic State as depressed, people walking around as subjugated citizens in chains, beaten down by strict, totalitarian rule.“But really, apart from some rather chilly but very sunny December weather, life here in Mosul is business as usual.”The hostage has been held captive for more than two years by Isis militants. In previous instalments he has delivered his message under duress from behind a desk and wearing an orange jumpsuit. The last video featuring the photojournalist, released in November, saw him give an account of what he claims was a failed rescue attempt by US forces in July. In it Cantlie said he accepted “long ago” that his fate was “overwhelmingly likely” to be the same as other captives.Other footage released by the group in October purported to show him in the embattled Syrian city of Kobani.Cantlie’s father Paul, 80, died from complications following pneumonia last year. His sister, Jessica Cantlie, has previously appealed for “direct contact” with the militants holding him.Since August, Isis has posted online films of the deaths of four western hostages: UK aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines, and American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, who were all beheaded on camera by the jihadi organisation.",Sat 3 Jan 2015 22.57 GMT,"['Islamic State', 'Iraq', 'Middle East and north Africa', 'Mosul', 'news']"

Unicef, the UN children’s agency is collaborating in the project.Survivors in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia will be given smartphones and will document their stories and exchange tips on how to cope with it for a mobile app which will be available to the public, the backers said in a statement.“While treatment of Ebola patients is critical, the best way to end the Ebola outbreak in west Africa is to cut the chain of transmission and prevent further infections,” Rafael Obregon of Unicef said in the statement.“#ISurvivedEbola is reinforcing our efforts by providing this information in multiple, highly entertaining forms, including through the testimonies of actual survivors,” Obregon said.Survivors who have agreed to contribute include Camara “Fanta” Fantaoulen in Guinea who lost six members of her family to Ebola, and Decontee Davis, a 23-year-old from Liberia who overcame Ebola but lost her fiancé.",Sun 4 Jan 2015 20.18 GMT,"['Ebola', 'Mobile phones', 'Africa', 'news']"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/05/asio-isis-still-a-threat-despite-coalition-successes-in-syria-and-iraq,Asio: Isis still a threat despite coalition successes in Syria and Iraq,"The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, took spy agency’s advice when declaring al-Raqqa province in Syria ‘no-go zone’ for Australians","Islamic State (Isis) has “proven resilient” and remains a threat despite recent military operations against it in Syria and Iraq, according to a brief of evidence compiled by the Australian spy agency.The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio) provided the assessment as part of the process of declaring al-Raqqa province in Syria as the first “no-go zone” under the government’s new foreign fighter laws.A parliamentary committee is reviewing the government’s decision, announced in early December, to designate the area as off limits to Australians. Citizens who enter or remain in al-Raqqa face jail terms of up to 10 years – unless the travel is solely for a legitimate reason such as a bona fide visit to relatives.The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, has told the intelligence and security committee she made the declaration because she was satisfied that Isis, which is listed as a terrorist organisation under Australian law, was engaging in hostile activity in al-Raqqa.Bishop provided the committee with a copy of Asio’s “statement of reasons”, which she said she had carefully considered before making the decision.The statement said Isis, also known as Isil, had been operating in Iraq under various names since 2003 and had been active in the Syria conflict since late 2011.“Since January 2014, Isil has focused on capturing and consolidating control over large areas of Iraq and Syria. It operates across much of Iraq and Syria, but is based in the Iraqi provinces of Ninewa and al-Anbar and the Syrian province of al-Raqqa, which serves as its de facto capital,” the statement said.“Isil’s activities in these areas of Iraq and Syria, and calls by Isil’s leadership, have attracted thousands of foreign fighters, including Australians, who have travelled to Iraq and Syria to join Isil and engage in hostile activity.”On Sunday the prime minister, Tony Abbott, made a surprise visit to Iraq to discuss the campaign against Isis.The group sought to replace the Iraqi and Syrian government by capturing territory and the declaration of a caliphate spanning the established Iraq-Syria border and had launched frequent attacks on civilians, the Asio statement said.“Isil has proven resilient, having survived its earlier near-extinction at the hands of an international coalition that fought it for eight years,” it said.“Despite recent military operations against it in both Iraq and Syria, it remains an ongoing threat and conducts daily attacks throughout its areas of operation in Iraq and Syria.”The statement included a list of videos released by Isis showing beheadings, including five featuring American or British citizens.“On the basis of the above information, Asio assesses that Isil is engaged in hostile activities in al-Raqqa province, Syria,” it said. “This assessment is corroborated by information from reliable and credible intelligence sources.”In a human-rights statement attached to the declaration, the government said the listing was “compatible with human rights because it is a lawful, necessary and proportionate response to protect Australia’s national security”.The government said the declaration promoted the safety of Australians, including those seeking to travel to al-Raqqa and those who might be at risk by people who returned from the region with terrorism capabilities. The prosecution “must disprove any legitimate-purpose defence raised beyond a reasonable doubt, in addition to proving the elements of the offence”, it said.Labor supported the declaration of al-Raqqa and the passage of a series of counter-terrorism laws, but has been forced to defend its approach after mounting criticism from News Corp’s Daily Telegraph.Saturday’s Telegraph front page carried the headline: “Vows of death: Aussie jihadist brides schooled in terror as Labor helps them slip net”.The story argued Labor was “responsible for watered-down terror laws that make it harder to jail returning jihadis”. It said the government wanted to ban travel to certain counties but Labor insisted it be only to specific regions within countries, “which is almost impossible to prove”.The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, issued a statement describing the coverage as “inaccurate and irresponsible”, noting that the laws “were agreed to by a bipartisan security committee chaired by the government”.“These laws were passed by the government, with the bipartisan support of the opposition,” Dreyfus said.One of the changes recommended by the security committee, and accepted by the government, was to remove a clause in the bill that explicitly enabled the foreign affairs minister to declare an entire country as an effective no-go zone.Dreyfus said al-Raqqa was the only region declared under the legislation so far and there was “nothing stopping the government from declaring any further areas today if this is needed”.“The opposition continues to offer the government its bipartisan support on national security. We hope the government continues to share that commitment,” he said.The justice minister, Michael Keenan, said on Sunday a new hostage video released by Isis was “just another example of the barbaric terrorist organisation that we have committed to degrading and destroying”.Keenan said the government was “doing everything we can here in Australia to contain and control the very small number of people who might fall under their influence”.Legal groups and Islamic community representatives have previously raised concerns that the no-go zone provisions could allow people to be jailed for travel unconnected to hostile activities, would have a disproportionate effect on Australian Muslims, and the exemptions were not broad enough.The parliamentary joint committee on human rights argued in October that the new declared area provisions were likely to infringe on rights to a fair trial, the presumption of innocence, freedom of movement, the prohibition against arbitrary detention, and non-discrimination.",Sun 4 Jan 2015 20.05 GMT,"['Islamic State', 'Syria', 'Middle East and north Africa', 'Iraq', 'Julie Bishop', 'Australian security and counter-terrorism', 'news']"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/04/-sp-sherpa-families-everest-disaster-guides-avalanche-compensation,Sherpa families angry and fearful eight months on from Everest disaster,Struggling families of guides killed in April face further barriers and hardship despite compensation process finally starting• Sherpa guide families – in pictures,"Pasang Lhama Sherpa wakes up her five-year-old son from his corner bed in her dimly lit teahouse in Dingboche, north-east Nepal. With only a small cooking stove to warm the room, the pair exhale crisp clouds of condensation as she layers him in clothes to start the day.Pasang, whose husband, Then Dorje Sherpa, was one of 16 guides killed in an avalanche last April on Mount Everest, is worried about her son’s future.Without her husband’s income, the small shop supplying tea for sherpa guides on their way to Everest base camp does not bring in enough money to educate her son – and she fears he will end up on the mountains, like his father.“My husband did not love climbing,” the 28-year-old says. “He was only a mountaineer to earn money. He did not have a good education so he could only get climbing jobs to earn money to support the family.”Like some other families of the sherpas killed on Everest while guiding western tourists in April, Pasang has yet to receive compensation from authorities.After the disaster Nepal’s government initially promised just $400 (£255) to each victim’s family, causing widespread anger among the community. Sherpas and mountain guides threatened to cancel all climbing on Everest if Kathmandu did not increase the offer. Summit attempts were suspended for the season to honour those who had lost their lives.The government then offered $5,000 to each family, but has been accused of dragging its heels over the payments.In December, the first of the families received their compensation. “Yesterday seven victims’ family members took their compensation, and the government has already issued money to all the 16 victims,” says Yuba Raj Shrestha, an official at the mountaineering department of the ministry of tourism.But the Union of Trekking Travels Rafting Workers Nepal (Unitrav), which is representing the families, says that in order to claim compensation the next of kin have to travel to Kathmandu to present the required documentation.This is difficult for poor families in the mountainous Khumbu region, with travel being slow and expensive. Pasang says she has been unable to collect her insurance compensation this year because it requires a trip to the Nepalese capital, and that she has not been offered travel assistance. “I cannot collect the money without going to Kathmandu, but I cannot afford to go to Kathmandu,” she says.This apparent reluctance to accommodate victims’ families has added to the community’s anger, because Everest tours represent a significant revenue for the government, which charges westerners $25,000 each for a climbing permit. Families fear that after April’s disaster the cycle of poverty in the region will be intensified.Mingma Lhamu Sherpa, 70, is the mother of Mingma Nuru Sherpa, another of those who died in the avalanche. Her husband also worked on expeditions but died nine years ago – forcing her son, previously a monk, to become the family’s breadwinner, she says.“My son worked on the mountains three times, all on Everest. He started trekking to make money. He had no education, no occupation, no money, so he started going on expeditions and trekking. He was the only one making money for the family.”Mingma Lhamu now lives alone in her rural house, where she milks her one cow and grows potatoes to live. With no income, she only eats what she can grow. With old age taking its toll, Mingma says: “I am very worried. I’m always remembering my son but he does not come back.”Her son-in-law, Dorje Sherpa, who is also an Everest guide, visits from a nearby town to help with daily chores and work. Like most other guides, he chose not to climb to the summit this season. “I see dangers but we have no education, no occupation, no other jobs are available to us,” he says.The family of another victim, Dorje Khatri Sherpa, live in Kathmandu. Though this makes collect the compensation payment easier, the sum will not last forever, they say. The dead man’s eldest daughter, Doma Khatri Sherpa, has had to start work for the trekking firm that employed her late father.Doma Khatri Sherpa, 21, looks at a memorial to her father, Dorje Khatri Sherpa, who was among the 16 guides who died in the April avalanche.  Photograph: Charlotte PertAfter his death she was offered a job as receptionist/accountant for the company, but this has not solved their financial troubles. “He made the main source of income, after he died we haven’t known what to do,” she says.The family’s income now depends on Doma, who is the eldest of three children. She earns 11,000 rupees (£70) a month. Despite the long daily commute from the suburbs where her family lives to the tourist district for work, she is still not able to earn enough to look after her mother and two siblings.“After his death I’m still always thinking about him,” she says. “We are still using money he saved but we are unsure about the future.”Although the union representing the families has welcomed the fact that the compensation process has started, it says the lump sum payment is not enough beyond the short term.Unitrav’s biggest demand is not for better salaries or compensation, but for proper training for mountain guides to try to avoid similar disasters in the future.“People who died, they died. But the people left behind are the real victims,” says Phopu Thakche Sherpa, wife of Dorje Khatri Sherpa.Mingma Lhamu Sherpa, 70, now lives on her own. Her daughter and son-in-law visit from a neighbouring town to help with tasks when needed.

Now for the other 364, 1 January).However, when he repeats diversity campaigner Simon Albury’s comment that the only person of colour on Today was the one bringing the tea and coffee, he and Albury are not spotting the hope for the future. In my experience, if you talk to the runners who collect Today guests from reception and bring you coffee, you find that they are young graduates beginning their broadcasting careers and are starting on the production and/or journalism road, and I’ve undoubtedly met quite a few who are of minority ethnic origin. Some of them are women too. So the next generations of executives may well be more diverse.The biggest current problem is class. There aren’t many people of minority ethnic origin at the very top of broadcast journalism like Lenny Henry (factory worker father, secondary modern) from the working-class streets of Dudley. The best tend to be like Mishal Husain (doctor father, private school, New Hall, Cambridge) and Rageh Omaar (wealthy businessman father, private school, New College, Oxford).Catherine PepinsterEditor, The Tablet While racism is experienced across all classes, our media’s class bias is overwhelming. Most British journalists went to private school. Radio 4 is dominated by cut-glass accents. While 6.5% of the UK school-age population attend public schools, 64% of the most influential people in the media industry were privately educated. Seven of the nine BBC employees on the Media Guardian 100 list were privately educated. Most prominent British comedians, come to that, seem to have attended public schools.Recruitment from within the posh crew is all too often via dinner party and other personal connections. An emphasis on racism as personally rather than systemically constructed is in danger of feeding this: while transparent recruitment and selection policies would be better than accessing a posh BAME crew for now, in the long run we need to look to the class base – to economic democracy and the redistribution of wealth – in order to root out structural racism.Peter McKennaLiverpool I was distressed to read that Lenny Henry had been called “racist” for his choice of subject matter when he guest-edited the Today programme. Personally I found it refreshing and thought-provoking. I enjoyed listening to it, despite being a white woman in her 70s.However, I had the privilege of working for the Greater London council, under the leadership of Ken Livingstone. I taught history and careers education in London schools to black, Asian and minority ethnic pupils. I learned as much – possibly more – from them as they learned from me.As staff inspector for careers education, in the final days of the Inner London Education Authority, my team of schools industry liaison officers worked through the London compacts to develop the employability skills of pupils of all races and genders. These experiences made me aware how deeply entrenched racism is, in English society, along with the pernicious class system. Can we all make a new year’s resolution to eradicate racism and prejudice, wherever we find it – even in the BBC?Anne Dart TaylorHoneybourne, Worcestershire Lenny Henry admirably highlights the white male bias in the Today programme. His plea for more “black people, Asian and minority ethnics” may not include Gypsy and Traveller minorities. I have regularly acted as expert witness against anti-Gypsy racism.Before the catastrophic Dale Farm eviction, I accepted an invitation to be on Today the next morning. Before ringing off, I naively asked for the presenters’ names. I commented that one had fronted a documentary where he argued that foreign migrants were imported for seasonal work in Wisbech solely because the locals were psychologically “lazy”. No recognition that, for decades, the work was all done by Gypsies before the 1994 legislation restricted travelling. Minutes later, the BBC representative rang back: my Today participation was cancelled. Seemingly, even a white female professor, also with a PPE degree, was too threatening if she dared critique a white male presenter.Professor Judith OkelyAuthor, The Traveller-Gypsies To follow on from Lenny Henry’s version of Today (Henry’s Today takes on ‘devil’s avocados’, 31 December) presented by non-white people, could we have an experiment where the country is run by non-male people, just to see how it goes?Mary GildeaLondon",Sun 4 Jan 2015 19.35 GMT,"['Race', 'Lenny Henry', 'BBC', 'Radio 4', 'Radio industry', 'letters']"

Cologne Cathedral provost Norbert Feldhoff, told n-tv that shutting down the lights was an attempt to make the Pegida demonstrators think twice about their protest.“You’re taking part in an action that, from its roots and also from speeches, one can see is Nazi-ist, racist and extremist,” he said. “And you’re supporting people you really don’t want to support.”Only about 250 Pegida supporters showed up in Cologne, as compared to about 10 times that number of counter-demonstrators. Similarly in Berlin, police said some 5,000 counter-demonstrators blocked about 300 Pegida supporters from marching along their planned route from city hall to the Brandenburg Gate. Another 22,000 anti-Pegida demonstrators rallied in Stuttgart, Muenster and Hamburg, the DPA news agency reported.But Pegida’s main demonstration in the eastern city of Dresden, a region that has few immigrants or Muslims, attracted 18,000, according to police. The demonstrations there have been growing from an initial few hundred in October to around 17,500 at a rally just before Christmas.Carrying signs with slogans like “wake up” the crowd chanted “we are the people” and “lying press” as they passed television cameras on Monday.In uncharacteristically frank words in her New Year’s address, the chancellor, Angela Merkel, urged Germans to stay away from the Dresden rallies.When the Pegida demonstrators chant “we are the people”, Merkel said: “they actually mean ‘you don’t belong because of your religion or your skin.”Pegida organiser Kathrin Oertel slammed the speech at the rally Monday, telling the crowd: “In Germany we have political repression again”.“Or how would you see it when we are insulted or called racists or Nazis openly by all the political mainstream parties and media for our justified criticism of Germany’s asylum seeker policies and the non-existent immigration policy,” she asked the cheering crowd.Pegida has sought to distance itself from the far right, saying in its position paper posted on Facebook that it is against “preachers of hate, regardless of what religion” and “radicalism, regardless of whether religiously or politically motivated”.“Pegida is for resistance against an anti-woman political ideology that emphasizes violence, but not against integrated Muslims living here,” the group said.It has also banned neo-Nazi symbols and slogans at its rallies, though critics have noted the praise and support it has received from known neo-Nazi groups.Cem Ozdemir, co-chairman of the Greens party and himself the son of a Turkish immigrant, told n-tv that while he, too, was against any form of extremism, “intolerance cannot be fought with intolerance”.“The line is not between Christians and Muslims,” he said. “The line is between those who are intolerant … and the others, the majority.”In Berlin, anti-Pegida demonstrator Ursula Wozniak said she had joined the protest because she felt the Pegida group was abusing Germany’s democratic tradition.“What is happening right now in Germany is just extremely shocking,” she said.Pegida was forced to call off its demonstration early in Cologne, after organisers reported being blocked from marching along their planned route, police said.Other buildings, including several other churches and a museum, joined Cologne Cathedral in turning off their lights in support of the anti-Pegida demonstrators.In Dresden, carmaker Volkswagen decided to keep its glass-walled manufacturing plant dark, to underscore the company “stands for an open, free and democratic society”.",Mon 5 Jan 2015 23.47 GMT,"['Germany', 'Europe', 'The far right', 'Angela Merkel', 'news']"

But the two other judges who make up the panel accepted the motion, causing the trial’s onset to be postponed.“Genocidal killer! Justice is what we want, coward!” human rights activists and victims shouted after learning of the decision.Ríos Montt was convicted on the same charges in 2013 in what many considered a historic ruling for a nation still struggling coming to terms with its long and bloody civil war. Soon after, however, his 80-year sentence was overturned and a new trial ordered.In an interview last week at her dirt-floor adobe home in Nebaj, 88-year-old Magdalena Bernal de Paz recalled how villagers fled to the mountains when soldiers attacked in 1982.“They burned the corn, the house, the clothing,” Bernal told the Associated Press, speaking in the Ixil language as her granddaughter translated into Spanish. “They left us with nothing … It was all lost.”Bernal testified to all that in the 2013 trial. But now, she said, her health is too delicate to make the 155-mile (250km) trip to the capital.“Saying it once is enough. If they want me to retell it again, it will have to be here,” Bernal said.Several other witnesses at the last trial have passed away in the interim.Ríos Montt’s former chief of intelligence, General Mauricio Rodríguez, also appeared on Monday.“I am ready for the new trial. I want to end this humiliation already,” said Rodriguez, who added that he suffers from leukaemia.According to a UN estimate, 245,000 people died or disappeared during Guatemala’s 1960-1996 conflict, the vast majority at the hands of the armed forces or paramilitary bands.",Mon 5 Jan 2015 23.27 GMT,"['Guatemala', 'Americas', 'news']"

The rumors are just not true,” said Lieutenant Commander Gabe Somma, a spokesman for the coast guard’s seventh district in Miami.US authorities have captured, intercepted or chased away 421 Cubans since 17 December, Somma said.In all of December 2013, the total number of Cuban migrants who encountered US law enforcement while trying to reach the US was nearly half that – just 222.And just before the historic announcement of the US-Cuba detente – from 1 December to 16 December – only 132 Cubans were kept from reaching US shores.Some Cubans recently told the Associated Press they were thinking about speeding up their plans to get to the US, but others cautioned against attempting the dangerous crossing when it’s still unclear how US law may change.“I’m crazy to leave, but I’m not going to throw myself into the sea, I’m not going to do it,” Juan Moreno, 34, said in Havana on Monday. “Whoever does that is crazy.”The overall number of migrants making risky sea voyages toward US shores from the Caribbean, including Cuba and other countries, has spiked in the past year. According to the coast guard, in the fiscal year that ended 30 September, US authorities captured, intercepted or chased away at least 5,585 Haitians, 3,940 Cubans and hundreds from the Dominican Republic and other Caribbean countries attempting to sneak into the country.For nearly 50 years, Cubans have had a unique privilege. The Cuban Adjustment Act has given them a virtually guaranteed path to legal residency and eventual citizenship. Over the years, hundreds of thousands of Cubans have taken perilous raft trips to Florida and land journeys through Central America and Mexico with the knowledge that they would not be deported.Cubans caught at sea, though, are usually returned home.Now that the US and Cuba are negotiating a return to full diplomatic relations, many Cubans wonder how long wet foot-dry foot will continue.Coast guard officials stopped short of calling the recent surge a mass migration, but they said they are concerned about the increased numbers of migrants.“At one point last week, we had about 120 Cuban migrants on coast guard cutter decks awaiting repatriation,” Somma said.Some coast guard vessels and aircraft have been pulled from other missions in the region to address the increased migrant traffic in the waters off Florida, Somma said.",Mon 5 Jan 2015 22.40 GMT,"['Cuba', 'Miami', 'Americas', 'Foreign policy', 'Mexico', 'Florida', 'news']"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/05/rio-police-commander-dismissed-over-nazism-endorsements-and-coup-plot,Rio de Janeiro elite police chief sacked as 'pro-Nazi chats' revealed,Local magazine published inflammatory messages said to have been posted by head of a paramilitary battalion to fellow officers ,"The already thuggish reputation of Rio de Janeiro’s police force dropped a notch lower after the commander of an elite unit was dismissed on Monday for allegedly endorsing Nazism, plotting against a superior and inciting violence against anti-World Cup protesters.Colonel Fábio Almeida de Souza was replaced as head of the Choque Battalion of paramilitary police after Veja magazine published inflammatory messages that he is said to have posted to fellow officers using the WhatsApp chat service.The text conversations are reportedly taken from an internal investigation into an assassination attempt on a rival officer, whose home was peppered with bullets in January 2014.Although De Souza was cleared of that wrongdoing, the messages appear to suggest he and other members of the battalion plotted to create what they called a “Reich” inside the organisation. Referred to by his fellows as a “Fuhrer”, De Souza described his group as “pure race and flawless”.In one chat, De Souza predicted he would take leadership of the paramilitary police in Rio and then said he would inflict a “nuclear winter” on his enemies: “You will see what revenge is.” When his colleagues outlined plans for a coup, De Souza responded by writing “Germany 1930 standard”.During the street protests that racked Rio in June 2013, De Souza was asked about baton techniques for restraining protesters. He responded: “Kill them. That will immobilise them permanently.”Nobody was fatally shot during the demonstrations, but De Souza boasted to his fellow officers when he hit a protester with a teargas pellet from a pump-action rifle. “What pride!” he exclaimed.The messages call into question the judgment of Rio state’s top security official, José Mariano Beltrame, who promoted de Souza in November.Beltrame has denied reports that he had been previously warned about the messages. He said he was “horrified” by the chat between officers and is seeking a police investigation into De Souza.",Mon 5 Jan 2015 21.45 GMT,"['Brazil', 'Americas', 'news']"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/06/cuba-releases-political-prisoners,Cuba begins releasing political prisoners but slow pace frustrates some,State Department says ‘We would like to see this completed in the near future’ as names of those freed not disclosed for fear of jeopardising release of others,"Cuba has begun releasing some of the 53 political prisoners it agreed to liberate in last month’s historic agreement with the United States, marking a further step towards the normalisation of relations.But the slow pace and secrecy surrounding the releases remains a source of frustration in Washington and Miami, particularly in contrast to the high-profile treatment of the three Cuban detainees who were sent home from US jails as part of the deal.Underlining the differences, Cuba celebrated the birth on Tuesday of a baby conceived by artificial insemination while her father was still in prison thanks to one of the world’s more unusual diplomatic initiatives: a delivery of frozen sperm from Gerardo Hernandez to his wife’s doctors last year. The top story on the Cuban news website Granma on Tuesday showed the happy parents and their new daughter, Gema.In the US, feelings are more equivocal. While there was relief last month at the release of Alan Gross, a USAid contractor who was arrested by Cuban state security in Havana in 2009, there are still doubts about the slow progress in freeing domestic political prisoners.Three weeks after the deal announced by presidents Barack Obama and Raúl Castro, Cuba has released some of the detainees, but the numbers and names have not been disclosed for fear of jeopardising the chances of the others.The US Statement Department said this was not a precondition of the deal, but it would like to see the process completed soon.“They have already released some of the prisoners – we would like to see this completed in the near future,” spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters.Elizardo Sanchez, leader of the dissident Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, which monitors such detentions, told Reuters his organisation was not aware of anyone being released.“We don’t have any information up to now,” Sanchez said in a telephone interview in Havana. “No names ... We’ll wait and see.”White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters one reason the prisoners were not being identified was because “we don’t want to put an even bigger target on their back as political dissidents”.Critics of the rapprochement say the delays highlight Cuba’s untrustworthiness, but it may simply be a matter of time.The Obama administration has also not yet moved to liberate trade, financial transactions and travel permissions that it promised alongside the deal. US officials are also still assessing the prospects of removing Cuba from the list of states that sponsor terrorism.Senior diplomats from the two sides are due to meet later this month, when a stock-take of progress and future steps can be expected.",Tue 6 Jan 2015 23.57 GMT,"['Cuba', 'news']"

How about a side of yuca with that Big Mac?Venezuela’s more than 100 McDonald’s franchises have run out of potatoes and are now serving alternatives like deep-fried arepa flatbreads or yuca, a starchy staple of traditional South American cooking.McDonald’s is blaming a contract dispute with west coast dock workers for halting the export of frozen fries to the country. The dispute also caused several days of french fry rationing in Japan last month. But Sonia Ruseler, an Argentina-based spokeswoman for Arcos Dorados, which runs McDonald’s restaurants in Latin America, declined to say why Venezuela’s neighbours are not suffering from similar scarcity.Accustomed to shortages of their favourite foods, and equally in the habit of grumbling about the government as they walk away empty-handed, many Venezuelans assume the embattled socialist administration is to blame.“It’s because of the situation here; it’s a total debacle,” said María Guerreiro, who huffed out of a Caracas McDonald’s with her family when she found out they were serving only fries made of yuca, which is also known as cassava. Her daughter won’t eat the super-starchy root, she said, and they had come for the sole purpose of treating the two-year-old to a Happy Meal.Ruseler said the corporation is working to resolve the shortages, and in the meantime, “will continue to give our clients the McDonald’s experience, offering 100% Venezuelan options.”Rival Burger King, meanwhile, used sly social media posts to remind Venezuelans that some fast food chains are still offering American-style fries.John Toaspern, chief marketing officer with the US Potato Board, noted that Venezuela’s import of frozen potatoes fell off a cliff long before the labour dispute escalated. During the first 10 months of 2014, the country imported just 14% of the frozen fries from major McDonald’s supplier Washington State that it brought in for the same period the year before, according to federal data compiled by the board.Most of the shortages in Venezuela are driven in part by the country’s tight currency controls, which make it hard to get dollars at a subsidised rate for imports while creating a thriving black market for currency. As a result, the country either has the most expensive Happy Meal in the world ($27 at the official exchange rate) or the cheapest (90 cents at the black market rate).McDonald’s has probably been grappling with shortages in Venezuela for a while, according to Alixa Sharkey, a researcher with the market research company Euromonitor International. And while other countries might be able to adjust to hiccups at the ports by finding alternative solutions like flying in frozen potatoes, the dysfunction in Venezuela makes these workarounds impossible.“This situation probably has little to do with the US port dispute and is mostly the result of Venezuela’s very difficult economic situation,” she said.While McDonald’s may be the ultimate symbol of US capitalism, the socialist government seems acutely aware that Venezuelans relish their Happy Meals. A state-sponsored news website posted a story this week assuring the situation “has nothing at all to do” with government policy.At the Caracas McDonald’s, a man wearing an “employee of the month” cap braved the dinner rush on Monday, patiently explaining to patron after patron that instead of french fries, the store was offering yuca fries, mini-arepas, or salads.Nonplussed customers sampled their pale yuca fries tentatively as they picked up their orders. No one chose the salad.",Tue 6 Jan 2015 23.27 GMT,"['Venezuela', ""McDonald's"", 'Americas', 'Potatoes', 'news']"

His suitcase was packed with a pillow, a toy, some food and a bowl.The dog was microchipped, so the charity was able to find the dog’s name, Kai. The group was also able to track Kai’s previous owner whom the microchip was registered to.His previous owners said they sold him on the classified ads website, Gumtree, in 2013. The were unable to provide the charity with the address of the person who bought Kai.If found, the owner could be charged under Scotland’s Animal Health and Welfare Act.Scottish SPCA inspector Stewart Taylor said the case highlights the unfortunate consequences of selling an animal online.“Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible,” he said “If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible.”The Scottish SPCA said Kai is a “lovely dog with a nice nature”, and estimate that he is between two to three years old. The charity said it will care for the dog until they find him a permanent home.Ben Supple, a spokesman with the charity, told the Guardian on Tuesday afternoon that the prospect of Kai finding a loving home looks promising.“We haven’t as yet found a home for Kai though we’ve been inundated with offers and will ensure we find him the right owner,” Supple said.Anyone with information about Kai is urged to contact the charity’s animal helpline at 03000 999 999.",Tue 6 Jan 2015 23.06 GMT,"['Animals', 'Scotland', 'Dogs', 'Pets', 'news']"

It has been the target of US-led air strikes in both countries since September.The Observatory said the message “This is evil, you Sheikh” was found written on the corpse, which had a cigarette in its mouth. Residents in areas controlled by Islamic State have said the group has banned smoking in public.Islamic State has fought with other insurgents and cracked down on local populations. It has also killed its own members for what it describes as violations.Residents and activists say it has beheaded and stoned to death many people in areas it controls for being enemy fighters or for actions they see as violating their reading of Islamic law, such as adultery and blasphemy.In December, a similar self-declared police force in western Syria decapitated four men after accusing them of blasphemy, according to the Observatory. It reported a similar killing days earlier in the north of the country.The Observatory also reported on Tuesday that unknown assailants also tried to kill two Islamic State militants in al-Mayadeen city.

Merkel also praised Greece for making sacrifices as it abides by the terms of its bailouts from other eurozone governments.The Chancellor spoke out days after Der Spiegel reported that Merkel has changed her stance from 2012 when she said there was no alternative to Greek membership of the euro on the grounds that an exit could trigger a wider breakup of the single currency. Der Spiegel reported that Merkel and her finance minister Wolfgang Schauble are “no longer afraid that a Grexit could result in the collapse of the entire eurozone”.Merkel said: “I think one has to tell the people and the financial markets that I, as German chancellor and also the federal republic of Germany’s government have always pursued a policy of Greece staying in the eurozone. The commitments we entered into between troika and Greece and Greece and the European member states were abided by and respected.“Greece has actually made a lot of sacrifices for many, many people in Greece. These were very difficult years. We have come a long way and I have no doubt whatsoever in my mind that we will also be able to bring this to a successful conclusion – always guided by the maxim that, on the one hand, the Greeks have to do their own bit and, on the other hand, we have to show solidarity.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/07/charlie-hebdo-shooting-paris-magazine-target-raid,"Charlie Hebdo attacks: ‘It’s carnage, a bloodbath. Everyone is dead’",Paris magazine staff say gunman knew their targets in advance and entered the building like ‘an organised commando’ raid,"Eleven-thirty am, in Paris. Corinne Rey, known as Coco, a cartoonist who works for the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, had just picked up her daughter from a nearby creche. “When I got to the front door of the magazine’s building with her, two masked and armed men threatened us – violently,” she said. “They wanted to get inside, go upstairs. I tapped in the entrance code … They spoke perfect French. They said they were from al-Qaida.”The offices of Charlie Hebdo are at No 10 rue Nicolas Appert, one of an anonymous row of low-rise, low-rent buildings, their cracked cream facades splashed with patches of fresher paint covering the graffiti that are everywhere in this slightly scruffy corner of the 11th arrondissement.The gunmen Rey admitted had been dropped off outside, carrying Kalashnikovs, by a third man in a black Citroën – registration number CW 518 XV – with dark-tinted windows. They knew their business, police said: they wore balaclavas and bulletproof vests; they held their weapons professionally; they “moved calmly and appeared determined”.They chose their moment, too. Wednesday morning is publication day for Charlie Hebdo, the occasion for the staff’s weekly editorial conference. Inside the second-floor conference room, some 15 staff members – cartoonists, editors, writers – had gathered for the mid-morning meeting, including four of the magazine’s most famous names: the cartoonists Cabu, Wolinski and Tignous, and the magazine’s editor since 2012, the cartoonist Stéphane Charbonnier, known as Charb.But witnesses to the bloodbath that was about to ensue said that once inside the building, the attackers seemed at first unsure where to go. According to tweets from Yves Cresson, who works for the media production company Bayoo next door to Charlie Hebdo, the two attackers initially walked into his offices.“At 11.25am, taking advantage of the postwoman, two armed men wearing balaclavas entered our offices,” he tweeted. “They were looking for Charlie.” Cresson said the men fired two bullets, which passed through a door and a window.One witness told Libération they asked a receptionist which floor Charlie Hebdo’s offices were on. An unnamed woman who worked in an office on the second floor, across the corridor from Charlie Hebdo, told France Info radio that she and her colleagues had first heard “a big bang. Then someone just threw open the door to our office, in one move, and demanded to know where Charlie Hebdo was. He had a rifle. We backed away. After he left, we heard gunfire. We went to the windows: there were two men running, with guns … They were shouting outside, and shooting again.”An anti-terrorism police source told Libération that the men gave every appearance of being “calm and determined … They clearly knew their target in advance”. Once inside the magazine’s offices, the source said, “they went straight to the conference room. They looked round the room and said, ‘Where’s Charb? Where’s Charb?’ They killed him, and then they sprayed the rest of the room with gunfire.” He said he did not rule out there having been other names on the target list of what was “an organised commando”.A man holds a drawing during a vigil for victims of the shootings, at Place de la République in Paris. Photograph: Eric Feferberg/AFP/Getty ImagesIt was Laurent Léger, a Charlie Hebdo writer, who managed to sound the alarm, according to a reporter from L’Obs magazine. Léger was in the conference room as the attackers opened fire and managed to make a phone call at 11.40. “He told the friend, ‘Call the police. It’s carnage, a bloodbath. Everyone is dead.’ Then the line went dead.”Ten members of Charlie Hebdo’s staff had been shot dead, the Paris prosecutor’s office would later confirm. Rocco Contente, of the Paris branch of the police union Unité, described the scene inside the office as “butchery. It’s carnage inside. They went in there to kill as many people as possible”.A 27-year-old witness identified only as Samy, who lives in a third-floor flat immediately across the street from No 10, told L’Obs that he “heard explosions”. He said: “At first, I thought it was just bangers. I went to my window and I realised they were gunshots. First outside, and then more, resonating in some kind of enclosed space. I saw two masked, hooded men, dressed in dark clothing and armed with Kalashnikovs come out, running, into the rue Gaby-Sylvia. I was in a state of shock. I saw someone coming out, injured, covered in blood.”Elsewhere on the street, there was terror. Fradji Guez said his four-month-old granddaughter Joanne was in the nursery near the Charlie Hebdo offices at the time of the attack. “The staff heard the shooting and were so frightened that they hid the children under the cots,” he said. “Of course, they didn’t know where the shooting was coming from. They were utterly terrified. My daughter-in-law phoned me beside herself and in tears. I had to go and get my granddaughter to reassure her she was safe. It’s horrific.”A woman lights a candle during a vigil in Lyon following an attack on Charlie Hebdo. Photograph: Jeff Pachoud/AFP/Getty ImagesSprinting out of the building, weapons in hand, the two attackers reportedly ran straight into a police car pulling up outside. There was an exchange of fire. Two policemen died; one, aged 42, from the 11th arrondissement, was calmly shot in the head at point-blank range while lying injured on the ground on boulevard Richard Lenoir. The second, officials confirmed, was Charb’s 49-year-old bodyguard, an experienced officer from the VIP protection squad. A third policeman was seriously injured in the leg.One neighbour saw paramedics trying to save an injured police officer on the road outside her office. “It was ghastly, awful,” she said. “We knew it was serious because they weren’t even trying to take him away to hospital. They were just trying to save him right there in the street. We are all in shock.”As the attackers jumped into the waiting Citroën, several witnesses reported hearing shouts of “Allahu Akbar”, as well as “We’ve killed Charlie Hebdo” and “We have avenged the prophet”.Driving away at high speed, the Citroën ran down a pedestrian, also reported to be in a serious condition. The attackers made it as far as the junction of rue Sadi-Lecointe and rue de Meaux, in the 19th arrondissement not far from the Place de Stalingrad, before abandoning the now damaged car. Cedric Le Bechec, 33, an estate agent, saw what happened next.French police stand next to funeral hearse in front of the entrance of the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo. Photograph: Francois Mori/AP“It all happened very calmly, with no shouting, no insults,” he told the freesheet 20 Minutes. On his way out of an appointment in rue de Meaux, Le Bechec watched as two men jumped out of “a small black car” carrying a rocket launcher. “The car was stopped in the middle of the street. Two big black guys dressed in military-style gear got out. “They pulled a man, around 60, out of the car behind, a grey Renault Clio. They climbed in and said, ‘You can tell the media we’re from al-Qaida in Yemen.’ I was five or 10 metres away. The guy said, ‘Wait, let me have my dog!’ They let him get his dog out of the car before they drove off. The police arrived five minutes later.”Shortly before midday, Paris police confirmed they had lost all trace of the attackers. Roadblocks were mounted on all main roads leading out of Paris and French media reported police were “confident” that the attackers had gone to ground somewhere in the city. Barely an hour afterwards, visiting the scene of the country’s worst atrocity in decades, a visibly shocked French president, François Hollande, described it as “a terrorist attack, without a doubt”. The attack was “an act of exceptional barbarism”, he said.Bernard Cazeneuve, the interior minister, confirmed the provisional toll from the attack as 12 dead and 11 wounded, including four seriously. More than 30 public gatherings were planned around France. More than 500 police officers were on duty across Paris.The Charlie Hebdo offices were last attacked barely three years ago, after the irreverent and often controversial weekly, first founded in the wake of France’s 1968 student revolt and resurrected in its present incarnation in 1992, put another cartoon of the Muslim prophet on its cover – since when, in principle, it has been under police protection.Police and rescue forces are seen near the scene of the shooting. Photograph: Christian Hartmann/ReutersIt first came to international attention in 2006, when its decision to reprint a selection of cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad, first published in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, sparked outrage across the Muslim world.The magazine courts controversy; at Wednesday’s meeting, its staff almost certainly discussed the cover of that morning’s issue, which featured the enfant terrible of French literature, Michel Houellebecq. His sixth and most recent novel, Soumission – or Submission – is published this week and imagines France in 2022, run by a Muslim president and according to the laws of conservative Islam. Someone on the staff had just tweeted its new year’s greetings to its followers, “including Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi”: a cartoon drawing of the Islamic State leader wishing everyone “the best of health”.A reporter at the magazine, Antonio Fischetti, who was not in the building on Wednesday, said the paper had lived with a threat over its head for several years. “We knew the threat was real,” he told Libération. “But it wasn’t complete paranoia. Threats against Charlie were recurrent, continual, habitual. There hadn’t been that many recently, but vigilance had been lowered a bit. After the 2011 fire, there was a police car outside in the street, at first all the time, then just during the editorial conference on Wednesdays. But for a little while now, a month or two, it hadn’t been there. They must have noticed that. They really waited for the right moment. Charb had his bodyguards, even when he came to dinner at mine. We thought Charb could be targeted.”Gael Fabiano, spokesperson for the police union UNSA-Police, said the killers appeared to have planned the attack well and described them as “cold-blooded”. He said the police were “confronting a new form of violence, and we have to adapt to that. We have to have the means to act. The police were already at Charlie Hebdo to protect it from such an attack, but these terrorists acted with such determination and cold-bloodedness, what could they do? These terrorists were armed with weapons of war.

He pulled out his weapon. It was his job, it was his duty,” said Rocco Contento, a colleague who was a union representative at the central police station for Paris’s 11th arrondissement.Video footage, which has now been pulled from the internet, showed the two gunmen get out of the car before one shot the policeman in the groin. As he falls to the pavement groaning in pain and holding up an arm as though to protect himself, the second gunman moves forward and asks the policeman: “Do you want to kill us?” Merabet replies: “Non, ç’est bon, chef” (“No, it’s OK mate”). The terrorist then shoots him in the head.After the rise in online support for the satirical magazine, with the catchphrase “Je Suis Charlie,” many decided to honour Merabet, tweeting “Je Suis Ahmed”. One, @Aboujahjah, posted: “I am not Charlie, I am Ahmed the dead cop. Charlie ridiculed my faith and culture and I died defending his right to do so.”Another policeman, 48-year-old Franck Brinsolaro, was killed moments earlier in the assault on Charlie Hebdo where he was responsible for the protection of its editor, Stéphane Charbonnier, one of the 11 killed in the building. A colleague said he “never had time” to pull his weapon.Brinsolaro’s twin brother, Philippe – a senior police officer in the Marseille region – said on Thursday that all French people should unite to condemn the massacre. “The whole of France must mobilise against the horror that struck our country yesterday. You can’t attack freedom of expression, attack the authority of the state in this way,” he was quoted as telling reporters.“Sometimes you get the feeling that the police are misunderstood by [French] people but it must not be forgotten that yesterday’s gesture shows that a policeman is ready to intervene at any time when he has to protect the nation.”Franck Brinsolaro, also from Marseille, had recently married a journalist, Ingrid, who ran a weekly newspaper in Normandy. Her newspaper chain issued a statement saying that editors “will never yield to threats and intimidation of the untouchable principles of freedom of expression”.But it was the image of Merabet’s killing on a Paris pavement that most shocked French police and the wider public.French police unions, which carried the now-universal message of solidarity in support of Charlie Hebdo #jesuischarlie, posted on their websites and on Twitter black banners proclaiming #jesuispolicier in memory of their two dead colleagues.Nicolas Comte, the deputy secretary general of Merabet’s union, Unité SGP Police, said colleagues had been “deeply affected by the video” and the assassination of the policeman “who was slaughtered like a dog”.Flowers and messages of condolence were piled outside Merabet’s police station, in a side street which was blocked off by metal barriers on Thursday morning. Armed police stood guard on the street and there were further barricades outside the police station entrance.Its telephone line played sombre music all day – an official day of mourning in France – and a policewoman said that Merabet’s colleagues were “very sad” at his passing.Merabet had been a policeman for eight years and had just qualified to become a detective. Rocco Contento, who as Paris regional secretary of the union knew Merabet personally, spent time with him at a course at the end of the year. He described him as quiet and conscientious. His family came originally from Tunisia, he said.Officials at the Bobigny business registry office said a person with the same name and age as Merabet ran a cleaning company between 2003 and 2006 in Livry-Gargan, a north-east Paris suburb where he went to school.The headteacher at the local lycée, Marie-Pierre Pillet, confirmed he had been a pupil from 1989 to 1995, but nobody remembered him because of the 20-year time lapse.Merabet was officially described as single, although he had a girlfriend, according to Contento.“Now we’re on a war footing,” said the head of the union France Police, Michel Thooris. “They’re out there with AK47s, the weapons of war.”On Thursday, a 25-year-old police officer, Clarissa Jean-Philippe, was killed in an attack in the south Paris suburb of Montrouge. The tragedy was not linked by her colleagues to the Charlie Hebdo atrocity. Thooris said that once the dust had settled and those responsible for both armed attacks were brought to justice, the police would be demanding action from the government.“Now isn’t the time to criticise, but for decades there have been no-go zones in the council estates where there are arms caches and drug running,” he said. “We must terrorise the terrorists.”",Thu 8 Jan 2015 23.53 GMT,"['Charlie Hebdo attack', 'Paris', 'France', 'news']"

Children and women, some were crying for help,” Mohamed Bukar said after fleeing to the state capital Maiduguri.The insurgency killed more than 10,000 people last year, according to a count by the Council on Foreign Relations in November. It is seen as the gravest threat to Nigeria, Africa’s biggest economy, and a headache for the country’s president, Goodluck Jonathan, ahead of an election on 14 February.Soldiers fled Baga over the weekend when the Sunni jihadist group overran a nearby army base.The district head of Baga, Abba Hassan, said on Thursday that at least 100 people were killed during an attack at the weekend when the group first took over the town on the edge of Lake Chad.Abubakar Gulama, who escaped without his family to Monguno, 40km away, said he crossed “many dead bodies on the ground” and that “the whole town was on fire“.Reuters TV footage showed scores of civilians waiting on sandy streets on the outskirts of Baga to catch buses out of town. Many carried the few possessions they had salvaged, such as bags of clothes and rolled up mattresses.In the last week, about 2,000 Nigerians and 500 Chadians have fled Boko Haram attacks in Chad’s Lake region, Chadian prime minister Kalzeubet Pahimi said on Wednesday.A source at a rights group in Maiduguri said some 10 women who snuck out of Baga a few days after the first attack had reported that their daughters aged between 10 and 20 had been kidnapped.The militants have been waging an insurgency to establish an Islamic state for more than five years.The number and scale of attacks rose sharply in 2014 after the government imposed emergency rule on the three worst-hit states in 2013, and the administration of President Jonathan has met growing criticism for failing to quash it.Jonathan defended his record on tackling Boko Haram at the launch of his election campaign and blamed opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari for Nigeria’s ill-equipped army.Boko Haram has taken over or rendered ungovernable swaths of the north-east, especially Borno state where Baga is located. It has also launched attacks in Chad and Cameroon, while Chad has appealed for international aid to support the refugees coming across its border.",Thu 8 Jan 2015 22.33 GMT,"['Boko Haram', 'Nigeria', 'Africa', 'news']"

The assistant secretary of state Roberta Jacobson, the top US diplomat for Latin America, will visit Cuba for the meetings on 21 and 22 January, which were originally scheduled to discuss migration but will now cover the re-establishment of diplomatic relations and formally reopening embassies in Washington and Havana.The State Department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said the talks will focus on how to “create safe, legal and orderly migration between the United States and Cuba”.But they also seek to advance the process initiated by presidents Barack Obama and Raúl Castro last month to re-establish US-Cuban relations after more than 50 years of estrangement. Although the two countries suspended diplomatic relations in 1961, they have held regular talks on migration.Meanwhile, opposition groups in Cuba said that eight political detainees have been released over the past 24 hours, including three on Wednesday, as Cuba moves to fulfil another element of its deal with the US.All but one of the released prisoners were members of the dissident Patriotic Union of Cuba (Unpacu).They had all been accused of relatively minor offences.The latest Unpacu detainees to be freed were Ernesto Riveri Gascón, Lázaro Romero Hurtado, Emilio Plana Robert, and Yohannes Arce Sarmientos, Unpacu said.Romero was arrested in 2012 and sentenced to four years behind bars on charges including making a public disturbance and threats, apparently during a confrontation with police. Riveri was given two years on the same charges.Plana was detained in 2012 and given a three-and-a-half-year term for his activities with the opposition, dissidents said, and Arce had been awaiting sentencing after being arrested last year on similar allegations.Another detainee freed on Thursday was named by dissidents as José Manuel Rodríguez Navarro. They said he was detained in 2013 and sentenced to four years in prison, allegedly for writing letters denouncing Cuba’s government.Cuba’s government does not comment on police actions involving detentions, and has said nothing about this week’s releases. It typically describes dissidents as being in the pay of the United States.Elizardo Sánchez, president of the dissident Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, which monitors such detentions, said more releases were expected on Thursday and over the coming days.“That could indicate the start of the process … under which around 50 Cuban political prisoners would be released from custody,” Sánchez said in a statement.José Daniel Ferrer, executive secretary of Unpacu, said 36 members of his organisation remained in custody.All eight of those freed so far appear on an informal list drawn up by dissidents, but it is not known if they were on the official list of 53.Details about the prisoners who will be freed have been withheld by both governments, providing ammunition for Republican congressional opponents and other hardline critics of the policy shift.One US congressional aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters on Wednesday that Cuba was resisting the release of some prisoners on the list, but a White House official denied that, saying the US government fully expected all 53 to be liberated.",Thu 8 Jan 2015 22.10 GMT,"['Cuba', 'US foreign policy', 'Americas', 'news']"

Three gunmen also died.Marc Cooper, a journalism professor at University of Southern California at Annenberg, had called not running the pictures “absolute cowardice”.“Dear Marc, appreciate the self righteous second guessing without even considering there might be another point of view,” Baquet said in a comment on Cooper’s Facebook page. “Hope your students are more open minded. Asshole.”“Of course there is a second view,” Baquet said in another comment. “And I welcome it. But your note was thoughtless and arrogant. It didn’t invite argument. It invites so what you got [sic].”“I welcome vigorous debate,” he said, “not righteous cheap shots.”“Understand you disagree,” he added. “But there was a thoughtful discussion to be had. Next time I promise we will have it. But I bristle at arguments like those of [commenter Bernard] Fauchier who think it was a question of courage. It was not.”“Thanks for the chance to exorcise my demons now. Dean.”Cooper told the Guardian he did not know how he became Facebook friends with Baquet, and that the comment came as a surprise.“I thought it was really silly,” Cooper said. “He has more important things to do [than] to be so thin-skinned, and to be so nasty, and so sensitive with somebody that he doesn’t really know.”“If he wants to debate it with me,” Cooper added, “he’d be welcome.”The New York Times later issued its own comment. “Dean responded passionately to an arrogant comment that seemed intended to provoke,” said a representative. “In the end, these are very difficult decisions and Dean made this one with great care, understanding that there would be people who disagreed – many of them reasonable and civil, some less so.”The article Cooper’s post originally linked to was one in which the Times’ public editor, Margaret Sullivan, described the process by which Baquet reached his decision, which she wrote involved “seeking out the views of senior editors and reaching out to reporters and editors in some of the Times’ international bureaus”.Baquet’s position on whether to publish the cartoons is one that the Guardian shares.",Fri 9 Jan 2015 23.14 GMT,"['Charlie Hebdo attack', 'France', 'New York Times', 'US press and publishing', 'New York', 'news']"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/09/charlie-hebdo-attack-brothers-killed-police-hostages-jewish-supermarket,"A ruthless enemy, hostages and trail of murder: France’s worst nightmare","After three days on the run, jihadi brothers who had brought terror to Paris were cut down in a hail of police bullets. Nearby, four shoppers lay dead in a Jewish supermarket• Five killed in Paris as manhunt for gunmen ends","The end came shortly before dusk on Friday. There was a flash of orange and the unmistakable rattle of automatic gunfire. From the roof of a printing works in the small town of Dammartin-en-Goële white smoke billowed. An operation by French police special forces – three commandos in black appeared briefly in the gloom – had ended in hard-won success.Lying dead outside the building were Chérif and Saïd Kouachi, who had emerged, guns blazing, before being cut down in a hail of bullets. The two brothers had been at the centre of a massive manhunt since Wednesday, when they stormed the offices of the magazine Charlie Hebdo, shooting dead 10 people and two policemen, one murdered in the street with a clinical shot to the head.The raid came after a day of extraordinary drama in France, and a second siege which played out on the terrified streets of Paris. Within minutes of the Dammartin explosions, police stormed a kosher supermarket in the Porte de Vincennes area. Another gunman – 32-year-old Amédy Coulibaly – had taken shoppers hostage there on Friday lunchtime. Coulibaly was part of the same jihadi cell as the Kouachis, and he reportedly demanded the safe passage of his friends in the printing works. There were loud booms as commandos in Paris went in straight through the front door. A few heart-stopping minutes later they emerged, leading – and in one case carrying – a party of dazed, shaken survivors. Coulibaly had been shot dead.But then came news that four hostages had been shot dead too, with four critically wounded. Police officials said the hostages had died at the beginning of the Paris siege, when Coulibaly opened fire inside the building with a Kalashnikov. It was a deeply dispiriting conclusion to three days of carnage in and around the French capital. The numbers told their own doleful story: 17 people dead, including a policewoman shot dead by Coulibaly on Thursday, as well as the three gunmen. Many other civilians had been injured.The twin operations marked the end of a rollercoaster 72 hours, during which the French authorities and security forces had frequently appeared helpless and buffeted by fast-moving events. After the massacre inside the magazine offices of Charlie Hebdo, the police mounted one of France’s biggest ever searches. The brothers had fled north, hijacking a Renault Clio. On Thursday morning they robbed a petrol station north-east of Paris. Then they vanished.The police operation to find the killers concentrated on a large area of woodland in rural Picardy, dotted with small, picturesque villages. For almost 24 hours there were no clues. Then at 8.10am on Friday the brothers surfaced in the small village of Montagny-Sainte-Félicité, population 400. It is unclear where they spent the night. But they had a problem: the Renault Clio they hijacked in Paris – telling the driver “We’re al-Qaida in Yemen, if anyone asks” – had run out of petrol.A local teacher watched the two suspects seize her grey Peugeot. Nobody was going to argue with them, the woman said: they were heavily armed, dressed in black and carrying a rocket-propelled grenade launcher. They exited the village and made for the N2 motorway north-east of Paris. They drove south, back towards the capital. Half an hour later, they encountered a police roadblock. They opened fire. The police responded. Nobody was hurt. The suspects were forced to dump their Peugeot and run across a field.The brothers’ options were rapidly shrinking as the manhunt entered what looked like its final stages. They found themselves in a small industrial estate in Dammartin-en-Goële. The town, population 8,500, sits in a flat basin surrounded by low hills; nearby is Charles de Gaulle airport. It was a wet and dreary morning. Rain fell from a white sky, with mist clinging to a line of trees.The two fugitives took refuge in a local printing works. At 9am a man called Didier popped into the building for an appointment with the owner, Michel. Standing next to Michel was a strange figure dressed in black. The figure was heavily armed, wearing combat gear and with a bulletproof vest. There was only one explanation, Didier thought: this was a police officer.“We all shook hands and my client told me to leave,” Didier told French radio. The figure said calmly: “Go, we don’t kill civilians.” Didier thought the encounter “strange”. He left the office perplexed, exiting through blue-painted doors into a car park. “As I left I didn’t know what it was. It wasn’t normal. I didn’t know what was going on. Was it a hostage-taking or a burglary?”Within minutes armed police teams sealed off the area, telling residents to lock their doors. The small rural community found itself plunged into uncertainty and dread. Teachers taking classes at the village’s three schools shooed small pupils away from windows; adults and children sat on the floor together and sang nursery rhymes.“Everyone here is blocked in their homes. There are four or five helicopters flying overhead and an extraordinary number of police and gendarmes,” one resident, Gregory, told French TV. The suspects had taken refuge inside the utilitarian, cube-shaped office of Creation Tendance Découverte, he said, a small family printing business employing five people.The drama was taking place just 300 metres from his home, he added. “There is a lot of fear. We’re scared,” 14-year-old Louis Zenon said.It appeared only a matter of time before the terrible national trauma of the previous 72 hours was brought to a conclusion. By late morning the police edged closer towards the two-storey building; sharpshooters took up positions on a neighbouring roof. There were reports that the Kouachi brothers had taken one person – possibly Michel – hostage. This looked like the endgame.And then at 1.30pm local time came shattering reports of another hostage situation, this time at the kosher market, 15 miles away from the siege in Dammartin. A man brandishing a Kalashnikov had burst in to the ground-floor supermarket. Next door is the district of Saint-Mandé, known for its large Jewish community. The dark grey building sits in rue Albert Wellemetz, a side street close to a busy intersection. Emblazoned on the side are the words: “Hyper Cacher” or Super Kosher. Nearby is a petrol station and a delicatessen. Several shoppers were inside. One witness, Fabian, told French media: “There was an individual – African – who had a Kalashnikov … and he immediately went into the deli and he started shooting.” Fabian said at least two people had been killed, with others injured.The rapidly unfolding crisis was turning into a nightmare for the authorities, who found themselves dealing with a ruthless and diffuse enemy, capable of making mayhem in multiple locations. Some 88,000 officers had been deployed, and yet at that moment they seemed powerless. Police swiftly identified the gunman as Coulibaly. It was the same man they suspected of shooting down the 25-year-old trainee policewoman, Clarissa Jean-Philippe, on Thursday morning in the southern suburb of Montrouge. Her killer had escaped. Now, seemingly, he was back.Initially police believed the shooting in Montrouge and the attack on Charlie Hebdo were unrelated. Now, they understood, they were the work of the same jihadi group. Detectives said on Friday that the Kouachi brothers and Coulibaly knew each other. According to Le Monde, the three men were committed followers of the convicted terrorist Djamel Beghal. As the siege in Paris continued, officials released a photo of Coulibaly’s missing 26-year-old partner, Hayat Boumedienne.The attack – apparently premeditated, and against a soft Jewish target – deepened the sense of horror among Parisians still reeling from Wednesday’s multiple murders. In the Marais, the historic Jewish quarter of Paris, shops downed their shutters. Nobody could rule out further atrocities. Detectives said Coulibaly had opened fire and declared chillingly: “You know who I am.” About 150 people were at a police roadblock outside the Lycée Hélène Boucher near the supermarket. Some were onlookers but many were waiting for pupils to be allowed out of the school which was shut at 1pm as a precautionary measure.Colette Cymbor said her 18-year-old daughter would normally have finished school at 4pm. “I spoke to her and she said they’ve not had lessons this afternoon,” she said.With tensions running high and amid the constant scream of sirens, the crowd broke into spontaneous applause when a contingent of police arrived on foot. Kevin Debuire, who was also waiting for Cymbor’s daughter Mélodie, said he was becoming increasingly concerned about taking the Metro after the spate of attacks.Back in Dammartin-en-Goële the standoff continued. There were reports that Coulibaly had demanded the police withdraw from Dammartin, tying the fate of the Kouachi brothers to that of the hostages inside the supermarket and still alive. The infant and primary schools, 500m from where the brothers were holed up, were evacuated in the afternoon. Buses were sent to the secondary schools in the town to pick up the children. Deputy mayor Thierry Chevalier described it as a “precautionary measure”. Valérie Desayeux arrived to pick up her 13-year-old son David, but was told to wait. “It never even crossed my mind the two men would come here. My older son who lives in Paris alerted me when I was at work. I tried to call the school several times and was getting more and more worried. Someone from the school finally called back at lunchtime,” she said.According to a local councillor, Yves Albarello, the brothers had told negotiators: “We want to die as martyrs.” Reports suggest that the commandos hacked inside the CCTV cameras inside the printing shop. They also shut down all mobile communications. When the operation began the Kouachis reportedly came out firing – and were immediately shot. Miraculously, their hostage was released unharmed.The brothers got their wish. They left behind a traumatised and wounded nation, glancing nervously over its shoulder, wondering what’s next.",Fri 9 Jan 2015 21.24 GMT,"['Charlie Hebdo attack', 'Paris', 'France', 'news']"

This means it has achieved the World Health Organisation’s benchmark for Ebola-free status.District council chairman Sadiq Silla credited an early decision to close markets, and ban social activities and worship in churches and mosques. He put the emergency measures in place before Sierra Leone’s president took action, and suffered strong local opposition and death threats as a result.“My house was physically attacked and I have to thank the police who protected me from the mobs,” he said.Pujehun’s achievement is a glimmer of hope for the country, where the disease is thought to have killed almost 3,000 people, with almost 10,000 confirmed, probable and suspected cases. The virus can kill within five days.“We must treat this milestone with caution as well as hope. We have a long way to go to even start turning the tide on Ebola in Sierra Leone,” said Nik Hartley, head of Restless Development, a British-based charity that employed more than 70 people in the district.But James Fofanah, country director for the charity, told the Observer: “We are all quite excited about it given the level of effort that went into it since the start. It’s quite a relief to have reached 42 days.”Hesaid district leaders were “hesitant about celebrations”: there remained a high risk that a new case would come from a neighbouring district, or from Liberia, and begin a new infection chain.Hopes are high that the disease is on the retreat in eastern Sierra Leone: neighbouring Kailahun district – the centre of the epidemic last summer – is now 27 days without a case. Freetown and other parts of the west and north, including Port Loko and Bombali, are still seeing relatively large numbers.“There are signs that case incidence may have levelled off in Sierra Leone,” said the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response in its latest situation report. Warning against complacency, it said 11 of Sierra Leone’s 14 districts had new confirmed cases.Sierra Leone has been hardest hit by the Ebola crisis, with 7,718 cases confirmed up to 9 January, more than neighbouring Guinea and Liberia combined. The capital had 89 cases in the week to 9 January, compared with 153 the previous week and 199 cases in the first week of December.The fragility of the countdown is illustrated in the districts of Kenema and the remote diamond mining district of Kono. Kenema recorded a new case on 4 January, after 19 clear days.Kono had few cases until early December, when someone travelling from another district infected a family. The lack of hospital facilities for Ebola led to rapid infection, with 87 bodies discovered after the alarm was raised. Red Cross workers were helicoptered in and evacuated the local hospital. The UN says Kono has suffered 32 confirmed cases during the last reporting week and 84 confirmed cases in the past 21 days.",Sat 10 Jan 2015 22.39 GMT,"['Ebola', 'The Observer', 'Sierra Leone', 'Africa', 'World Health Organization', 'news']"

My brother was killed by terrorists, by false Muslims’",Ahmed Merabet was the first police officer at the scene of the Charlie Hebdo attack. He was shot dead in cold blood. Now his brother has appealed for calm,"Ahmed Merabet, the police officer gunned down in the Charlie Hebdo attack, was killed in an act of barbarity by “false Muslims” his brother said in a moving tribute on Saturday, where he also appealed for unity and tolerance.Speaking for a group of relatives gathered in Paris, Malek Merabet said the terrorists who ignored his brother’s plea for mercy as he lay wounded on the street may have shared his Algerian roots, but had nothing else in common.“My brother was Muslim and he was killed by two terrorists, by two false Muslims,” he said. “Islam is a religion of peace and love. As far as my brother’s death is concerned it was a waste. He was very proud of the name Ahmed Merabet, proud to represent the police and of defending the values of the Republic – liberty, equality, fraternity.”Malek reminded France that the country faced a battle against extremism, not against its Muslim citizens. “I address myself now to all the racists, Islamophobes and antisemites. One must not confuse extremists with Muslims. Mad people have neither colour or religion,” he said.“I want to make another point: don’t tar everybody with the same brush, don’t burn mosques – or synagogues. You are attacking people. It will not bring back our loved ones and it will not bring peace to the families.”His brief speech was a moving tribute to the slain officer, loved as a son, brother, companion and uncle, but also a powerful call for harmony.There has been a rising tide of Islamophobia in France following the Paris killings, including a grenade attack on one mosque, an explosion in a kebab shop beside a mosque and gunfire at a Muslim family in a car, although there have been no casualties.Merabet’s death was captured in a graphic video, as he was wounded by one of the two attackers and then shot in the head in cold blood. He is shot in the groin, then falls to the pavement groaning in pain and holding up an arm as though to protect himself.The second gunman moves forward and asks the policeman: “Do you want to kill us?” Merabet replies: “No, it’s OK mate,” but the terrorist then shoots him in the head.The images were widely shared online and one was published on the front page of a national newspaper.Malek berated media outlets and websites that showed the graphic content, which he said was extremely painful for the family. “How dare you take this video and broadcast it? I heard his voice, I recognised him, I saw him being killed and I continue to hear him every day.”Ahmed’s partner, Morgane Ahmad, who said she had watched footage of the shooting without realising it was him, also appealed for calm.“What the family and I want is for everyone to be united, we want everyone to be able to demonstrate in peace, we want to show respect for all the victims and that the demonstration should be peaceful,” she said.Ahmed had been a pillar of the family since his father died 20 years earlier, Malek said. The 42-year-old grew up in Livry-Gargan, in the north-eastern suburbs of Paris, and graduated from the local lycée in 1995. He ran a cleaning company before joining the police force eight years ago, and worked hard for a promotion.“Through sheer determination he had recently passed the CID entrance exam and was due to come off the beat. His colleagues describe him as a man of action who was passionate about his job,” Malek said.Merabet was called to the scene of the attack while on a bicycle patrol and arrived just as the killers were making their escape. They stopped to add him to the long list of victims.“He was on foot, and came nose to nose with the terrorists. He pulled out his weapon. It was his job, it was his duty,” said Rocco Contento, a colleague who was a union representative at the central police station for Paris’s 11th arrondissement, where Merabet was based. He described him as a quiet and conscientious officer who was always smiling and widely liked.As news spread that the gunned down policeman was a Muslim, the hashtag #JeSuisAhmed began spreading on Twitter in solidarity. One user, identified as @Aboujahjah, said: “I am not Charlie, I am Ahmed the dead cop. Charlie ridiculed my faith and culture and I died defending his right to do so.”

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/10/greece-election-u-turn-antonis-samaras-syriza,Greek PM Samaras forced into U-turn as Syriza closes in on election victory,"With two weeks until Greece votes, Antonis Samaras needs a miracle to defeat Alexis Tsipras’s radical left party, say pollsters","With elections barely two weeks away and every poll against him, Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras began to sing from a different hymn sheet this weekend, focusing on his government’s handling of the economy in a desperate bid to win round voters.Unveiling a plan of national growth and reform in Athens on Saturday and dropping claims that a vote for the leftwing Syriza party would lead Greece into chaos, the premier sought to convince Greeks that only his conservative New Democracy party could guide the crisis-plagued country to economic recovery.“The strategy of fear that the conservatives have campaigned on clearly hasn’t worked,” said Paschos Mandravelis, a prominent political commentator. “Greeks are not buying the theory that the opposition poses a danger, so now Samaras is altering course.”The change of tactics for the snap elections forced on the government by parliament’s failure to elect a president, comes at a critical juncture. In every opinion survey, Syriza is in the lead. Last week, for the first time, pollsters began to speak of the impossibility of the lead being overturned. Less than three years after he took office at the helm of a coalition and at the height of Greece’s economic crisis, it was going to take a miracle for Samaras, 63, to keep power.“The difference is between a rough three and four percentage points and I don’t see it closing,” said professor Dimitris Keridis, who teaches political science at Athens’s Panteion University. “Samaras is facing the inevitability of defeat,” he told the Observer.A Metron Analysis poll released late on Friday showed Syriza leading, with 27.1% against 23.8% for Samaras’s New Democracy. Between 9 and 16% of voters are undecided.But even if the conservatives drum up support among the undecided, few believe the radical leftists – once on the fringe of Greek political life but now centre stage and determined to change economic debate in Europe – will not emerge on top on 25 January. On the back of pledges to repudiate the onerous conditions of the EU- and IMF-sponsored bailout accords that have shored up the debt-stricken Greek economy but have brought ordinary Greeks to their knees, Syriza has seen its popularity soar. Its belief that Athens’s unsustainable debt load should also be written off has won applause from other hard-left groups in Europe.“The question is not if they win, but by how much,” said Mandravelis.In stark contrast to Syriza’s Alexis Tsipras, who at 40 is the country’s youngest political leader and has waged a relaxed campaign, Samaras has frantically crisscrossed Greece, often visiting several cities on a single day. Until now, his rhetoric has been based solely on sounding the alarm. If Greeks vote for Tsipras and his “drachma lobby” party, Athens will face the danger of almost certain ejection from the eurozone – and by extension the EU. “It will mean the loss of all the sacrifices Greeks have made since the crisis began and be a catastrophe for the economy,” Samaras has maintained.Senior figures in the EU have backed up that view, saying in no uncertain terms that a vote for Tsipras is a vote for danger, replete with uncertainty and risk.But with more than 25% of Greeks out of work and close to three million facing poverty, the EU interventions have led increasingly to accusations of interference. Five years into their worst crisis in living memory, the vast majority no longer care about creditors’ demands but rather their ability to survive.“I am seriously thinking of voting for Syriza because I am sick of all the scaremongering from people who brought us to this place,” said Elena Christodoulaki, a hairdresser in Athens, adding that at 64 she had never supported the alliance of Marxists, Maoists, Trotskyists and Greens. “It’s not just that I want to see a change. With all this talk of leaving the euro it has been very difficult for them [the radical leftists] to have a say or [expound on their beliefs] which makes me mad.”On Friday, parties unveiled their campaign lists, with the conservatives announcing that a former talkshow host, a model and an actor would be running as candidates. Syriza’s ticket includes academics based abroad including Costas Lapavitsas, an economics professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, who has become a prominent advocate of resolving Greece’s woes within the eurozone.“Europe has failed to have a constant voice in its approach to Syriza,” said Keridis. “There have been a lot of contradictory statements regarding the threat the leftists represent for the eurozone,” he added. “That has helped Tsipras dilute any fear that he is anti-European and allowed him to win support.”",Sat 10 Jan 2015 22.33 GMT,"['Greece', 'The Observer', 'European Union', 'Europe', 'Euro (Business)', 'Euro (World news)', 'European monetary union', 'Austerity', 'news']"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/10/sri-lanka-president-maithripala-sirisena-promise-change,"Sri Lanka’s new president promises ‘no more abductions, no more censorship’",Maithripala Sirisena pledges new era for country after surprise election win topples bloody regime of Mahinda Rajapaksa,"Sri Lanka’s new government has moved swiftly to dismantle the authoritarian rule of the outgoing president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, pledging to stop blocking websites, end intimidation of the media and reopen an investigation into the murder of a high-profile journalist.Analysts had described the election as the most significant in Sri Lanka for decades and a last chance for democracy in the island nation. Maithripala Sirisena, the 63-year-old veteran politician who left the previous government to lead the opposition to a surprise win, was formally sworn in on Friday night.Many had predicted widespread violence, particularly as the opposition campaign gathered momentum. In the event, the poll went smoothly with a record turnout exceeding 81%. The final count gave Sirisena 51.2% of the votes. Rajapaksa, who called early elections confident of winning an unprecedented third term, conceded defeat early.Opposition figures claimed on Saturday night that the smooth transition was due to senior officials and the army refusing orders from the outgoing government to deploy troops in Colombo, the cultural and commercial capital.Speaking on Saturday at a press conference alongside an army spokesman, Rajitha Senaratne, a parliamentarian who defected to Sirisena and is likely to be an important minister in the new cabinet, said a plan to declare a state of emergency had been thwarted.“The army chief was under pressure to deploy, but he ... declined to carry out the instructions. Rajapaksa tried to stay in power till the last moment. It was when he realised that he could not, that he left,” Senaratne said.The MP said the new government would reopen an investigation into the murder of Lasantha Wickrematunge, editor of the Sunday Leader, who was gunned down in Colombo in 2009 and was a trenchant critic of Rajapaksa.Sirisena’s new prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, told reporters on Friday that they are “free to report whatever you want without the fear of being abducted”, and said a programme of internet censorship enforced by the former regime was also being lifted.Lal Wickrematunge, Lasantha’s brother, told the Observer on Saturday that he could provide new information about the killing to any inquiry. “There is no better signal of the new government’s avowed intention to assure media freedom than opening investigations into the assassinations, abductions and assaults of journalists, media personnel and media institutions,” he said.Activists critical of the government have been routinely intimidated in recent years, with several disappearing after being picked up by white vans believed to be used by the security services. They include Prageeth Eknaligoda, a political cartoonist, who was last seen being bundled into a vehicle near his office in January 2010.Legal documents filed by the Sri Lankan government during habeas corpus hearings in Colombo describe Eknaligoda as having been “abducted by an organised group”. Last year his wife called for international pressure on the government to either release her husband or inform her of his fate.Rajapaksa won a second term easily in 2010, surfing a wave of popularity after overseeing a final bloody victory over ethnic Tamil separatists that ended a crippling 26-year civil war.His decision to seek early polls may have been more a recognition of growing unpopularity than a show of strength, however. The benefits of brisk economic growth have failed to reach the poor, especially in rural areas, and there was anger at corruption and apparent nepotism.An adamant refusal to act on reconciliation with the Tamil minority and growing sectarian violence denied Rajapaksa votes among other constituencies, while votes from the Tamil-dominated former war zone in the country’s north and in areas with large Muslim communities appear to have played a key role in Sirisena’s victory.Rajapaksa fell out with the west over war crime allegations involving the deaths of thousands of Tamil civilians in the final phases of the civil war in 2009, and refused to cooperate with a UN-mandated investigation, leading to Sri Lanka becoming increasingly close to China.Moves to concentrate power on the president and weaken the judiciary led the then UN commissioner on human rights, Navi Pillay, to warn of authoritarianism in late 2013.Activists welcomed the announcements on Saturday. “If the government is serious about establishing democratic values in the country, then strengthening media freedom and freedom of expression is an integral part of that,” said Sunil Jayasekara, convenor of the Free Media Movement, a campaigning coalition in Sri Lanka.“But words would not be enough – there needs to be decisive action that shows the government is serious.”Many newspapers scrambled to keep up with the sudden shift in power. The state-run Daily News, which ran a fierce campaign against the new president, relegated Rajapaksa to a stamp-size photo at the bottom of the front page. Just a day earlier, the newspaper had printed that the idea of defeat for the incumbent “seems to be a figment of the imaginations of various interested parties”.Rajpal Abeynayake, the editor since 2011, explained that as it was state-owned the newspaper’s job was to “reflect the line of whatever government is in power”.“If the government changes, so does the newspaper. It’s as simple as that. If they want to change that practice they could, but so far no government has done it,” he said.",Sat 10 Jan 2015 22.26 GMT,"['Sri Lanka', 'The Observer', 'Tamil Tigers', 'Human rights', 'Censorship', 'news']"

High taxes and poor administration hamper business and the economy is not expected to grow in 2015.“I expect a certain shift in foreign policy, with a little more focus on Nato and the EU and a little less on the [Balkan] region,” said Andjelko Milardovic of the Institute for Migration and Ethnic Studies, a Zagreb-based thinktank, adding that the result was a pointer to the parliamentary election.Josipović, who was seeking a second five-year term with the support of the increasingly unpopular Social Democrats, won the first round of the election on 28 December by a narrow margin.Grabar-Kitarović, 46, a former foreign minister and ambassador to the US, campaigned on the need for a change of course and a more active head of state to help the country overcome its worst economic crisis since independence in 1991. She takes office as Croatia’s first female president on 19 February.The HDZ ruled Croatia from its first democratic election in 1990 until its founder, President Franjo Tudjman, died in December 1999.Since then it has alternated in power with the Social Democrats but has never regained the presidency.",Sun 11 Jan 2015 22.53 GMT,"['Croatia', 'Europe', 'news']"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/11/mentor-charlie-hebdo-gunmen-uk-based-djamel-beghal,Mentor of Charlie Hebdo gunmen has been UK-based,Djamel Beghal has been on western intelligence agencies’ radar for 15 years and has worshipped regularly at Finsbury Park mosque,"Djamel Beghal, who has emerged as a mentor to two of the gunmen involved in last week’s attacks in Paris, has been on the radar of western intelligence agencies for more than 15 years.The French-Algerian moved from France to Britain in 1997, and became a regular worshipper at London’s Finsbury Park mosque and a disciple of the radical preachers Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada. He came to be seen by UK and French intelligence as one of al-Qaida’s leading recruiters in Europe.He was back in the news last week after it emerged that he was one of the links between Chérif Kouachi, one of the brothers behind the Charlie Hebdo massacre, and Amedy Coulibaly, who killed four hostages in a Paris kosher supermarket and also a policewoman.French investigators believe Kouachi was radicalised by Beghal in prison, where he was serving a 10-year sentence for a plot to bomb the US embassy in Paris. Kouachi later visited Beghal when he was under house arrest in the Auvergne region of southern France. So did Coulibaly and his partner, Hayat Boumeddiene. She told police that they had gone there for “crossbow practice”.Beghal left Algeria to study in France when he was 22. He married Sylvie, a French citizen, in 1990, while working as a youth worker and attempting to recruit Islamic converts in Corbeil-Essonnes, a small town on the river Seine south of Paris.His first known contact with the authorities dates back to 1996, when he was questioned in France because his phone number had been found in the possession of a suspected terrorist. He was allowed to go free but remained under close surveillance in France.In 1997, Beghal moved his family to Leicester, apparently earning money by making sandwiches and working for a homeless charity while studying information technology. But he made frequent trips to London and the Finsbury Park mosque.According to legal documents in the case against Abu Qatada, who was deported from Britain after an 11-year battle, Beghal became an “extremist” under the influence of the preacher and was a member of a group involved in “distributing propaganda material” around Britain with Abu Qatada. Abu Qatada is also believed to have inspired him to move to Jalalabad in Afghanistan in November 2000.When he was arrested at Abu Dhabi airport in July the next year, he claimed to have been travelling from Pakistan to Morocco with the wife and children of a friend. But he was suspected of returning to Europe to lead Osama bin Laden’s war on the west after a year of training with senior al-Qaida commanders in Afghanistan.In a vivid account of his interrogation in Abu Dhabi given to the campaign group Cage in 2011, Beghal claimed he had been forced to endure deafening sounds and suffocating smells while being deprived of sleep, food and light.Beghal said he had been interrogated and beaten by a British-accented agent who asked him solely about his connections with the UK. He said he was questioned about Leicester and prominent Muslims in London – chiefly Abu Qatada. “They wanted me to accuse Abu Qatada at any cost,” Beghal told Cage. “He would insist with brutality to reveal the link between Abu Qatada and Osama bin Laden, whom he called Abu Abdallah.”Under interrogation, Beghal admitted to receiving training in Afghanistan, to meeting Abu Zubaydah – a key lieutenant of Bin Laden – and to travelling back to France to attack the US embassy in Paris.Back in France he withdrew this confession but was convicted in March 2005 on terrorism charges and was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment.He was released in 2009 but put under house arrest in the village of Murat, in the Auvergne, where he appears to have been visited by several aspiring jihadis including Kouachi and Coulibaly. They were all arrested in May 2010, accused of attempting to free Smaïn Aït Ali Belkacem, a convicted terrorist jailed for a 1995 bombing of the Paris metro.Beghal’s wife, Sylvie, still lives in Leicester with their four children in a four-bedroom terraced house overlooking a park. She is mounting a supreme court challenge to anti-terrorist legislation after she was questioned by police on 4 January 2011 at East Midlands airport.She was cautioned for failing to disclose information requested by officers under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act.She pleaded guilty at Leicester magistrates court, but later brought unsuccessful appeals to the high court and court of appeal. In November 2014, she took her legal challenge to the supreme court, supported by the Muslim Council of Britain, Islamic Human Rights Commission and Cage.In a statement after one court hearing, Sylvia Beghal said: “Once again my husband is punished for something he didn’t do … We just want to be left alone and live a peaceful life.”",Sun 11 Jan 2015 21.33 GMT,"['Charlie Hebdo attack', 'Abu Qatada', 'Abu Hamza', 'France', 'Europe', 'MI5', 'UK security and counter-terrorism', 'news']"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/12/refugees-detention-despite-security-clearance,Refugees kept in detention despite being told they had security clearance,"Two men, who were part of a group of seven told they would be released after Asio reversed its negative security assessment, are still in detention","There are grave concerns for the mental health of two refugees who have been in immigration limbo for over five years following adverse security findings.The two men, one a Sri Lankan Tamil, the other a Kuwaiti who has been in detention since he was a teenager, raised red flags when first assessed by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio) several years ago.They were part of group of 54 people who had been found to be refugees but were not released because they were deemed a risk to national security. The group were never told what the security concerns were, and therefore were never able to challenge them.Asio has been quietly reversing its findings and releasing the refugees.The two men were part of a group of seven who were told before Christmas that they would be released. Five were, but the other two were not.“They were told [by the department of immigration] that they were no longer a risk and that they were going to be released,” said Pamela Curr from the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre.“They were asked to pack their belongings. They went to have their medical checks and told on Friday they would be released.”But last Monday that decision was overturned, with no explanation offered to the refugees or their lawyers.They are now awaiting a decision from the new immigration minister, Peter Dutton, as to whether they will be released. Dutton’s office has been contacted for comment.The duo had been depressed and were feeling hopeless since being denied release, Curr said. “They’ve spent their fifth Christmas in detention,” she told Guardian Australia.There are still a number of people in indefinite detention, the department of immigration concedes.“There are 34 people who have been determined to be a refugee currently in detention who are subjects of an adverse security assessment issued by Asio,” a spokeswoman for the department told Guardian Australia.Among them is a Sri Lankan mother of three, Ranjini, who gave birth to her son Paari in Sydney’s Villawood detention centre in January 2013.Ranjini’s status as a refugee, which was determined by Australian authorities, means she cannot be returned to Sri Lanka as she was found to be in danger of persecution. Ranjini is the widow of a member of the Tamil Tiger separatist group, and admits she was a member of the group when she was younger.The head of the New South Wales Council of Civil Liberties, Stephen Blanks, said Australia had made security determinations about Tamil asylum seekers based on its close relationship with the Sri Lankan government.Sri Lanka’s outgoing president Mahinda Rajapaksa, whose government was unexpectedly defeated in last week’s election, has been accused of committing war crimes against the Tamil minority in the dying days of the civil war.“Given the election result in Sri Lanka, it is time for Asio to reassess whether assessments made of Tamils are still relevant,” Blanks told Guardian Australia.He said he hoped Dutton would take a “fresh look” at the refugees who were still in limbo following adverse security assessments.“It was never appropriate to lock these people up,” he said.Blanks said the fact that the refugees had been released quietly over the past few years meant it was likely they were never a real threat to in the first place, but he said the secrecy around the issue meant the public would never know for sure.",Sun 11 Jan 2015 21.07 GMT,"['Refugees', 'Australian immigration and asylum', 'Australian politics', 'Sri Lanka', 'Kuwait', 'news']"

In fact, there is a great deal citizens of the rich countries can do to combat Islamic fundamentalism. First, the western powers should withdraw politically and militarily from the Middle East. Every western intevention for the past 150 years has served to strengthen fundamentalist Islam. In particular, they should immediately cut military and political collaboration with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey, which are the principal backers of Isis and Wahhabism (whatever their recent protestations). Second, the people of the western countries should give every support we can to the brave and beleaguered secular and democratic political currents in “the Muslim world”, such as the Labour party of Pakistan and the trade unions in Iraq and Egypt.Third, in Britain, we should be campaigning for state schooling which is completely secular, depriving the Church of England and the Catholic church as well as other smaller churches of their anachronistic control of state schools. This is the medieval and barbaric hangover that should concern us. Parents have (limited) rights to impose their religion on their chilrden, but a democratic state has no business indoctrinating children in any religion.Please stop wringing your hands and get involved in politics that can really change things.Jamie Gough Sheffield I was disturbed by the letters in Friday’s Guardian. The responses made me ashamed to be a Guardian reader. Rather than condemning the killings, almost all played them down, tried to excuse them, or suggested the victims had somehow brought them on themselves. What’s happened to us? Have the past 15 years been so bloody that some people have run out of sympathy, and have none left for innocent cartoonists being gunned down in cold blood?Alasdair MurrayRichmond upon Thames, Surrey Some of your correspondents have argued that the right to free speech must be tempered by the avoidance of offence. Whilst I applaud the humane values underlying this claim, I must disagree. There is not – and never could be – any universal definition of what is offensive. we all have our own internal calibration of what offends; I cannot know what you think or might feel and so any stricture that bars me from saying something offensive will inevitably fuel a creeping self-censorship which is the antithesis of freedom of speech.To live in a free society is to risk being offended. We can complain; we can retaliate; and we can shout aloud our discomfort. What we cannot do is shoot those who offend us. Je suis Charlie.Kath ChecklandHope Valley, Derbyshire Freedom of speech is a relative concept already limited by legislation. Libel, slander and incitement to racial hatred are crimes, as is denial of the Holocaust in Germany. Perhaps we should discuss whether figurative representation of Muhammad should be banned in the interests of public safety and social harmony, while continuing to tolerate satire of religion or any other belief or ideology. Such a limitation would hardly constitute a crippling assault on values that most of us hold dear, but might assuage concerns of many who are offended by images of the prophet.Simon SweeneyYork Your editorial (9 January), which defends the decision to not publish the Charlie Hebdo cartoons by appealing to the faulty logic underlying the calls to publish them as a matter of freedom of speech, is misguided. The cartoons have now become part of a news story and for that reason alone should be published. It is the responsibility of a media organisation to keep its users well-informed so they can form their own opinions on these issues. We should not have to search for this information elsewhere. David LobinaLondon Has the Guardian taken all leave of its senses in donating £100,000 to Charlie Hebdo? The “war on terror” is fought on two fronts. One is the hard war in the form of bombs and tanks. The other is the soft war in the form of the ideological demonisation of Islam. Charlie Hebdo quite consciously played its part in the soft war. It is no Private Eye. And the claim it is left is a dubious one. For when it comes to Islam many parts of the French left have a shabby record, from the way the French Communist party opposed Algerian independence onwards. While the killings have to be opposed, is it any wonder that when petrol is poured on the raging fires of Muslim-baiting some people are liable to be burnt? By donating this money to a journal that the Guardian itself would condemn if its so-called satire were directed against Judaism, it seems to have learnt nothing.John Curtis Ipswich, Suffolk  I too want to resist the language of “war” (Tariq Ramadan, 10 January), whether metaphorically or literally meant, and whether it refers to a fight against politically motivated killings, against a particular religion and its adherents, or against terrorism as a phenomenon. Safety and human rights cannot be protected by violent hostility. They can come only from the building of understanding and respect, locally and globally. It will be hard to escape the dynamic of spiralling action and reaction but it must be done. We need the language of wisdom and kindness, not the language of war.Diana FrancisBath Watching the Unity March of 1 million-plus people in Paris on Sunday, it reminded me of the Iraq anti-war march of up to 2 million people in London and 15 millon people in 800 cities around the world on 15 Februrary 2003.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/12/south-dakota-same-sex-gay-marriage-ban-struck-down-federal-judge,South Dakota same-sex marriage ban struck down by federal judge,Ruling says ban ‘deprives same-sex citizens of a fundamental right’ but immediate stay pending appeal means marriages can’t yet start,"A federal judge struck down South Dakota’s same-sex marriage ban on Monday, in a “detailed and powerful” move that LGBT advocates hoped would lead to a once-and-for-all ruling on the issue by the highest court in the United States.The decision was immediately stayed pending a possible appeal in the eighth US circuit court of appeals, meaning same-sex marriages are still not permitted in the state.Judge Karen Schreier ruled the state’s ban is unconstitutional because it “deprives same-sex citizens of a fundamental right, and that classification is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest”.With the holdup in South Dakota and a US supreme court decision on Monday not to take up a case in Louisiana, same-sex marriage remains legal in 36 states and Washington DC. South Dakota voters approved an amendment banning the practice in 2006.The case, Rosenbrahn v Daugaard, was filed in May 2014 to challenge the state’s law, which defines marriage as between one man and one woman. “Plaintiffs have a fundamental right to marry,” Schreier wrote in her opinion. “South Dakota law deprives them of that right solely because they are same-sex couples.”Lawyers with the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) filed the suit on behalf of six South Dakota couples. Five of the couples married in states that permit same-sex marriage and want their marriages recognized by the state. The sixth couple would like to marry in South Dakota.NCLR staff attorney Christopher F Stoll said in a statement that he hoped Monday’s decision would hasten the supreme court’s decision to issue a nationwide ruling on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage.“We are thrilled for our clients and for all same-sex couples in South Dakota, who have watched and waited as progress has been made in so many other states, and who can now see light at the end of the tunnel in their own state,” Stoll said. “We are also grateful to Judge Shreier for writing such a detailed and powerful analysis and for affirming in such strong terms that same-sex couples have the same fundamental freedom to marry as others.”Opponents of same-sex marriage have long argued that the issue should be decided by state governments, not courts. Schreier, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1999, attacked that line of thinking in her ruling.Schreier said that because South Dakota amended its constitution to block same-sex marriage in 2006, the state legislature is clearly not waiting to take up the issue. “[T]he act of incorporating the same-sex marriage ban into the state constitution sends the message that South Dakota’s same-sex marriage ban is not a temporary state of affairs but rather a fundamental statement of the state’s public policy,” she wrote.Schreier also accused the defendants’ attorneys of making a “slippery slope” argument by insisting that legalizing same-sex marriage would allow South Dakotans to question the state’s right to regulate marriage based on polygamy and incest.The South Dakota case is likely to soon join cases from Missouri and Arkansas that are before the eighth circuit. Lower-court judges in both states ruled that their respective bans were unconstitutional, and the decisions were quickly stayed pending appeal. Plaintiffs then filed for an appeal in the eighth circuit, as those in South Dakota are expected to do.Same-sex marriage is already legal in the eighth circuit states of Iowa and Minnesota. The final two states in that appeals court’s jurisdiction, Nebraska and North Dakota, are on track to be in the final group of states to defend the bans.The eighth circuit court of appeals is in the unusual position of having ruled to uphold a state same-sex marriage ban already. That ruling, however, arrived before the landmark supreme court decision to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act (Doma) in June 2013.After Doma was struck down, state bans began to fall across the country, leading them through a similar appeals process to the one now facing South Dakota.Only the sixth circuit has ruled against same-sex marriage since and the four states its decision applied to have been distributed to the supreme court.",Mon 12 Jan 2015 22.31 GMT,"['LGBTQ+ rights', 'Equal marriage', 'South Dakota', 'US constitution and civil liberties', 'US politics', 'Law (US)', 'news']"

It was the first reported word from the Cuban revolutionary leader in nearly three months.The network funded by Venezuela, Cuba and other allied governments showed photos of Maradona with the letter signed by Castro, 88. Telesur revealed nothing about the contents of the letter, except that it rebutted reports of his death.Telesur is broadcast on state television in Cuba, where Maradona has been filming episodes of a television show he hosts.No images were shown of Castro, who has not appeared in public since January 2013, prompting widespread speculation about his health as well as recent rumours of his death on social media.A serious illness forced Castro to relinquish his duties as president in 2006, handing over leadership to his younger brother, Raúl.The new wave of speculation about Fidel’s health was prompted in part by his failure to comment after the US and Cuba declared on 17 December that they would move to restore the diplomatic relations ruptured a half century ago.The most recent official photographs of Castro came out of a private meeting with the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, on 21 August. He was also photographed with the Chinese and Russian presidents in July.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/12/white-house-apologizes-not-sending-top-officials-charlie-hebdo-march-paris,White House apologizes for not sending top officials to Paris unity march,White House strikes apologetic tone – ‘This kind of symbolism is important’ – but cites ‘more onerous’ security precautions for US president as reason for absence,"The White House has issued a rare statement of regret over its decision not to send a more senior US representative to Sunday’s anti-terrorism march in Paris, as Barack Obama’s perceived lack of public solidarity with European allies helped create a political storm in Washington.At its first press briefing since last week’s attack, the White House struck a more apologetic tone as growing criticism of its decision not to attend threatened to overshadow its official response to the attack.“I think it’s fair to say that we should have sent someone with a higher profile to be there,” spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. “We here at the White House should have made a different decision,” he added, though he insisted the president was not consulted personally on the decision.Seventeen people died in Paris last week when Islamist terrorists attacked the office of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people, and a kosher supermarket, killing four; a police officer was also shot dead by the man who attacked the supermarket.Charlie Hebdo attackers: born, raised and radicalised in ParisRead moreThe US secretary of state, John Kerry, earlier on Monday had dismissed concerns about the conspicuous absence of US politicians among other world leaders at a march in honour of the victims as “quibbling”, though hurriedly announced his own plan to visit Paris later this week.Typically, the Obama administration takes a dim view of the importance of “optics” in such circumstances, but the incident threatens to rekindle criticism among political opponents that Obama’s foreign policy has become too isolationist.“This kind of symbolism is important ... Those kinds of expressions of solidarity are meaningful,” said Earnest. “We want to send a clear message even in a symbolic context like this that the American people stand shoulder to shoulder with France,” he added.The only mitigation offered by the unusually contrite White House communications team was to point out that the extra security precautions necessary to accommodate the president or vice-president could have disrupted the march.“There is no doubt that had the president attended the march, the security precautions would have had an impact on those who attended the march,” said Earnest.“The march came together at 36 hours’ notice outdoors,” he added. “The security precautions for the president of the United States are sometimes more onerous than other leaders.”But the White House acknowledged that such security concerns could nonetheless have been overcome and offered no explanation for why the attorney general, Eric Holder, who was in Paris for meetings that day, did not attend instead of Obama or Biden.Criticism of the decision came particularly from Republicans in Congress but was expressed most vividly on the front page of Monday’s New York Daily News and also shared by some French commentators.US officials said an apology would be offered if necessary to the French ambassador when he visited the White House later on Monday, but insisted comments to date show that France understood the depth of American support and solidarity.Earlier, Kerry announced he would make the short trip “to make it crystal-clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there”.“As soon as I heard about the plans for the march that took place yesterday, I asked my team to figure out what the earliest is that I could travel to Paris in order to show, once again, to reaffirm the connection between the United States and our oldest ally,” he told reporters during a pre-scheduled visit to Gujarat, India.“And so, I will be traveling there on Thursday, and be there Friday, part of Friday. And I want to emphasise that the relationship with France is not about one day or one particular moment. It’s an ongoing, long-time relationship that is deeply, deeply based in the shared values, and particularly the commitment that we share in freedom of expression.”But Kerry rejected accusations that he and Obama had erred in not joining fellow world leaders at the event.“I really think this is sort of quibbling a little bit, in the sense that our assistant secretary of state, Victoria Nuland, was there and marched,” said Kerry when asked if it was a mistake not to send a higher-level delegation.“Our ambassador was there and marched. Many people from the embassy were there and marched. And I believe that, as everybody knows, I have been here in India for a prior planned event. I would have personally very much wanted to have been there, but couldn’t do so because of the commitment that I had here, and that’s important to keep those kinds of commitments.”The fallout from the attack is likely to be top of the agenda for Obama when he meets with the British prime minister, David Cameron, in Washington later this week.",Mon 12 Jan 2015 20.52 GMT,"['Charlie Hebdo attack', 'Barack Obama', 'US politics', 'John Kerry', 'France', 'Paris', 'news']"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/13/freed-cuban-dissidents-speak-hopes-change,Freed Cuban dissidents speak of their hopes for change,Although many of the 53 prisoners released still face parole restrictions there is guarded optimism that the US-Cuban deal will create opportunities for activism,"Recently freed Cuban dissidents have described their plans to campaign for change on the island following the historic deal between Havana and Washington that led to their release.Fifty-three prisoners have been liberated under the agreement between the US president, Barack Obama, and his Cuban counterpart, Raúl Castro, on 17 December, most of them in the past week. Two others, who were not on the US list, have been freed.Although many still face parole restrictions, including a prohibition on overseas travel, concern about being returned to prison is mixed with optimism that the bilateral deal will create opportunities for activism.Angel Yunier Remón Arzuaga, a rapper known as “The Critic”, told the Associated Press that the US-Cuban detente “gives me the strength to keep demanding our rights and freedoms”.Arrested in 2013 after he said state security agents painted his house with pro-government slogans, leading to a fight with police, Remón was sentenced to six years for attacking state security. Held five miles from his house in eastern Cuba, he was loaded into a car on Thursday and driven outside the prison.“Right there they gave me a release document and said ‘get out,’” Remon said.“It’s a hard blow against the regime when they themselves have to let out people when they supposedly had proof that they’d committed crimes,” he said. He called the US-Cuba deal “a historic moment, an overwhelming event for my country, and I feel very proud”.Miguel Alberto Ulloa, a Havana resident arrested in 2013 for painting anti-government slogans, said he will stay at home until the charges against him expire in two months but that he’s “eager to go to the street, speak out, show that I’m dissatisfied”.He said he was optimistic the bilateral deal would bring change to Cuba.“I think that the Cuban people really need something like what was announced,” he said. “Now I have to keep fighting and find the path so that they don’t jail me again. I’m not going to stop.”Seventeen of the prisoners had already been released before the deal was announced, it emerged this week. Of the remaining 38, about a third are subject to “conditional release”, meaning they must periodically report to the courts supervising their cases, said the dissident Cuban Commission of Human Rights and National Reconciliation.Another third were released on parole, requiring them to serve out their terms outside prison but unable to leave the country, it said.Others were simply freed pending trial, with charges still intact, or had their sentences altered.Virtually all can be returned to jail for minor offences and some say they were told to stay away from opposition politics.“None of them have unconditional freedom. None of them,” said Elizardo Sánchez, leader of the commission, although he added he did not believe the government would harass them.Some have already begun testing the limits of their freedom. Haydee Gallardo, who was released last week along with her husband, took part in a protest march organised by the Ladies in White group on Sunday.Though she believes she is one of the few to have no conditions set on her release, she says she worries her husband Angel Figueredo could be returned to jail.“I don’t think the repression will stop considering that they continue to keep watch over us,” Gallardo told Reuters. “I’m afraid the repression will result in him getting locked up again.”David Bustamante, who was arrested in May for shouting demands for food from his rooftop, says he has been released subject to a curfew and warned not to resume political activism.“I don’t feel free,” Bustamante told Reuters by telephone. “They are snatching our freedom every day because we don’t have freedom of expression.”Martha Beatriz Roque has lived under what Cuba calls “extrapenal licence”, or parole, for 10 years. She is out of prison but unable to leave Cuba and presumes she is closely watched by state security.“There are a lot of things you can’t do and other things you don’t know whether you can do or not,” Roque said. “Those under extrapenal licence depend on a judge, to whom you have to report regularly. Those on conditional release are constantly responding to the justice system, any time the system decides.”The historic deal also involved a swap of prisoners convicted of espionage in both the US and Cuba. Three Cubans imprisoned in the US returned to a heroes’ welcome in Havana in December. On Tuesday the family of a high-level Cuban spy for the CIA revealed that the he was now in the United States.Rolando Sarraff, a former cryptologist in Cuba’s Directorate of Intelligence helped to crack a Cuban spy network in Florida. He was hailed by Obama as one of Washington’s most valuable assets when he announced the thaw in relations.In the first report of his whereabouts and wellbeing, his sister told the Associated Press that Sarraff was “free and doing fine”.",Tue 13 Jan 2015 23.38 GMT,"['Cuba', 'Americas', 'US foreign policy', 'Obama administration', 'news']"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/13/10-civilians-die-rocket-attack-ukraine-donetsk,Rocket attack that killed 10 civilians at Ukrainian checkpoint deals ceasefire blow,Shellfire heard across rebel-held Donetsk after bus driving near an army checkpoint in eastern Ukraine was hit by a separatist rocket,"An attack on a passenger bus in eastern Ukraine killed 12 people on Tuesday, probably dealing the final blow to hopes that a short-lived and shaky ceasefire could take hold.Across Donetsk, the city that Russian-backed separatists call their capital, explosions and the sound of shells whistling overhead are again unnerving the local population. The holiday period was spent in relative tranquillity after a new truce was called in December between government troops and Russian-backed militia. But by late last week, that uneasy calm was steadily unravelling.In the single largest loss of life so far this year, civilians travelling on a commuter bus from Donetsk were killed on Tuesday afternoon by what Ukrainians say were rockets fired from a Grad launcher in rebel territory. Regional authorities loyal to Kiev said the bus was passing a Ukrainian army checkpoint at the time, putting it in the line of fire.Leading rebel representative Denis Pushilin denied responsibility for the attack. The warring sides are now trading accusations over who is responsible for the breakdown in the truce that led to Tuesday’s deaths.Military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said that separatist attacks in recent days suggest an attempted onslaught to push back the frontline is under way. Separatist leader Alexander Zakharchenko said Ukraine’s armed forces unilaterally resumed hostilities and that his fighters would respond in kind.An AP reporter over the weekend saw a convoy of around 30 military-style trucks without licence plates heading for Donetsk, suggesting that new supplies were coming in for the rebels.Nato’s top commander, General Philip Breedlove, said on Tuesday that there has been a continued resupply and training of rebel forces over the holiday period. “Those continue to provide a concern and something that we have to be thinking about,” Breedlove said.Ukraine and the west have routinely accused Russia of being behind such consignments. Moscow flatly rejects the charges, although rebel forces are so well-equipped with powerful arms that the denials have become increasingly hollow.“These are separatists that are clearly backed by Russia,” the US State Department spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said on Tuesday, adding that Russia must do more to stop the violence and restore Ukrainian sovereignty.In the rebel-held Donetsk suburb of Makiivka, the thrash of outgoing mortars shakes still-inhabited neighbourhoods on a daily basis. Separatists have consistently denied using residential areas for cover, but there are ample eyewitness accounts undermining those claims.Ukrainian responses to artillery lobbed out of Donetsk are woefully inaccurate and regularly hit houses and apartment blocks, often killing people inside. The separatist military headquarters in Donetsk said on Tuesday that 12 people had been killed and another 30 injured in the preceding three-day period. It did not specify who had been killed.There is little sign of life in Makiivka these days. People rush home from work or aid distribution points and occasionally come out of shelters to exchange information about where shells are landing.Maria Ivanovna, a local retiree, told the AP she is inured to the blasts and drew an arc with her arm to show how shells fly over her home toward the government-held airport on the northern edge of the city.“We will survive the same way we did after World War II. Ration cards for bread. 300 grams [11 ounces] for children, 800 grams for factory workers and 1,200 grams for miners,” she said.A senior UN human rights official said this week that developments look poised to go in one of three directions a frozen conflict, an escalation in violence or an evolution to sustainable peace.“In case of frozen conflict, we will more or less continue to be seeing [the same] human rights violations that we have facing so far,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. “But in case of escalation of hostilities, which is quite possible, we could also be seeing further internationalization of the conflict and far more human rights violations and suffering.”The grimmest of outcomes appears most likely.A hoped-for round of peace negotiations this week between the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France has been put on ice possibly indefinitely. Ukrainian military authorities talk like they are bracing for the long-haul and on Tuesday laid out plans for a new round of mobilisation.Volodymyr Talalai, deputy head of the army’s mobilisation planning, said recruits will be drawn from all regions of the country. He gave no figure for how many people will be mobilised, but said that the primary aim of the upcoming drive is to enable the rotation of forces.Unremitting violence is radicalising the mood. One resident of Donetsk’s Petrovsky neighbourhood, one of the most intensely bombed, said she took up arms and joined the separatist army after a rocket hit a home in her neighbourhood.“A Grad landed … and people were killed and blown to bits,” she said, giving her name only as Vera. “How were we supposed to react? We are out here defending ourselves.”Wearing a balaclava and cradling an automatic rifle, Vera said her 19-year old son too wanted to sign up, but that she refused to let him.“I told them I would rather go myself than let my child do it,” she said.",Tue 13 Jan 2015 23.09 GMT,"['Ukraine', 'Europe', 'news']"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/13/cnn-drones-approval-federal-aviation-administration,CNN hopes to soar once more with the introduction of news-gathering drones,The cable network which is combatting sagging ratings is the first major TV enterprise in the US to be cleared to experiment with the camera-bearing devices,"With CNN suffering following what’s been deemed the network’s least-watched year since 1996, it’s only natural that the cable network would want to grab any new trick that could give it a ratings edge. No surprises then that the news organization has announced its latest passion: aerial drones.The Time Warner-owned company has joined the small but slowly expanding group of media and entertainment companies given a green light by the US government to start testing unmanned aerial vehicles in its news-gathering and other productions.It becomes the first major US television enterprise to clear tough hurdles imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration and gain permission to begin using so-called UAVs on a regular basis. Under an FAA deal known as a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, CNN will be allowed to begin experimenting with the camera-bearing devices while providing feedback to the federal agency that will help the Obama administration plan how to integrate drones into civilian airspace.CNN’s senior vice-president, David Vigilante, said in a statement that the network aimed to “get beyond hobby-grade equipment and to establish what options are available and workable to produce high-quality video journalism using various types of UAVs and camera setups”. On its side, the FAA said it recognized that “unmanned aircraft offer news organizations significant opportunities.”The network, which has been tinkering with its formula under new leadership – from extended coverage of a stranded Carnival cruise ship to the high-profile exit of Piers Morgan and entrance of personalities like Anthony Bourdain and Morgan Spurlock – joins a creeping rollout of the FAA’s move towards integration. The federal agency has been widely criticized for advancing at glacial speeds, raising fears that the US will fall behind other countries in exploiting this rapidly developing technology.Last month, Amazon warned that it might be forced to take its delivery drone testing abroad unless the US authorities loosened its stringent controls. The retail giant has ambitions to launch a UAV delivery service capable of dropping packages on the doorstep within 30 minutes of an online order.CNN’s foray into the world of airborne cameras already falls far behind some of its worldwide competitors – notably the BBC, which for months has been operating drones for filming through its Global Video Unit. The corporation runs an entire team of drone operators, including pilots who have trained for six months to acquire special licenses from the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority.One frequent complaint directed at the FAA is that it requires operators of unmanned planes to negotiate excruciating paperwork before they begin testing the devices. Each individual drone requires its own federal certificate.Last September, the US government signed up six movie companies to begin testing. But those permissions are limited to enclosed studios and are deemed by critics to be paltry compared to the vast pent-up demand in Hollywood to unleash the technology on modern film-making.",Tue 13 Jan 2015 22.42 GMT,"['Drones (military)', 'CNN', 'Television', 'Television industry', 'news']"

It did not happen, but it’s not me who refused to introduce myself,” Paul said in an interview. Now as de facto prime minister, he said he still planned to try to form a new government.“I’ve started consultations with political parties to compose my government, but the consensus is not easy to get,” he said.For weeks, opponents to Martelly have mounted street protests in the capital accusing the president and his family of corruption. The demonstrations took a more aggressive turn in recent days, with some protesters calling for a civil war.On Monday, Haiti marked the fifth anniversary of a devastating earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in the capital. Many Haitians are still homeless.On Sunday, with negotiations still underway to avoid an institutional vacuum, the US Embassy in Haiti issued a statement offering its support to Martelly.“The US will continue to work with President Martelly and whatever legitimate Haitian government institutions remain to safeguard the significant gains we have achieved together since the January 12, 2010 earthquake,” it said.In a weekend interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, Paul said he had to work on securing the trust of the international community.“It’s not easy because the crisis of confidence is based on a tradition of people not keeping to their word.“The country’s political divisions have led to a “chaotic atmosphere”, he said in an interview at the prime minister’s official residence late on Saturday as street protests continued.It is unclear when new legislative and municipal elections can be held.A tentative agreement late last month would have extended the terms of the deputies until 24 April, and senators until 9 September, allowing time to pass an electoral law and appoint an elections council.The political accord had been favorably received by Haiti’s largest foreign donors, particularly the United States and the UN, which have expressed concern that the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere is again on the brink of political chaos.The UN Tuesday called on all parties “to organize, as soon as technically feasible, inclusive, fair, transparent and equitable elections in 2015”, said UN spokesman Farhan Haq.Haiti is scheduled to hold presidential elections at the end of the year.",Tue 13 Jan 2015 22.23 GMT,"['Haiti', 'Americas', 'news']"

The Post’s Tehran bureau chief was detained alongside his wife, who was freed after 10 weeks, and two others who were also eventually released.Prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dowlatabadi’s announcement of Rezaian’s indictment, as reported by state-owned IRNA, comes a little more than a month after the journalist was formally charged by Iranian authorities. The brief statement simply said that “the case against Jason Rezaian has been referred for processing to Tehran’s revolutionary court”.Rezaian could now stand trial before Tehran’s special revolutionary court, which deals in cases ranging from espionage and state security to slander against Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The court could also move to review his case, which would keep Rezaian in a state of limbo.The five charges against Rezaian have not been made public, and may not even be clear to the accused or his lawyer, since the journalist can speak but not read Farsi and has not been allowed a translator. Rezaian’s mother told the Washington Post that Rezaian only knew the allegations pertained to “activities outside the bounds of journalism”. When asked by the New York Times what he knew of the charges, Rezaian’s attorney could only say, “I don’t know what happened.”Also on Wednesday, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, met the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammed Javad Zarif, ahead of negotiations about Iran’s nuclear programme. Zarif told reporters in Geneva that he hopes for a resolution to the case, “but unfortunately there are judicial issues involved which the judiciary has to deal with”.Kerry in December denounced Iran for denying Rezaian bail and has called for his release: “I am personally dismayed and disturbed at these reports, as I have repeatedly raised Jason’s case, and other cases of detained or missing US citizens, with Iranian officials.”The Geneva talks will include the US, France, Germany, Russia, China and the UK, and are part of glacial efforts at rapprochement by Iran’s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, and western powers.Rezaian’s wife and mother have been allowed to visit him briefly, according to both Zarif and his brother, and the journalist was allowed a half-hour phone call to his family on Thanksgiving Day. The family has pleaded for his release, including a direct appeal to Ayatollah Khamenei and in a December statement that said the courts had acted “in disregard of Iran’s own laws”.“This continued disrespect for Iran’s judicial system should be a concern not only to the international community,” the statement continues, “but also to all those Iranians who claim that Iran is a country of laws which should be recognised as such by major world powers.”Rezaian, accredited as a journalist by Iran’s culture ministry, had renewed his press credentials on the day of his arrest. The Washington Post and other newspapers and press organisations have urged Iran to release Rezaian.Iran kept 30 journalists imprisoned in 2014, according to the non-profit Committee to Protect Journalists, including several detained after a brief periods of freedom.",Wed 14 Jan 2015 21.37 GMT,"['Iran', 'Press freedom', 'news']"

Under the deal, the oil would be exchanged for Argentinian grain, Nisma said.The attack on the Argentinian Jewish Mutual Association centre was the country’s worst ever terror attack, and remains unresolved. Nisman’s investigation into the Amia bombing reached a dead end some years ago after Iran refused to hand over a number of officials, including the former Iranian cultural attaché in Argentina, Mohsen Rabbani, who is suspected of masterminding the deadly 1994 attack.The Jewish community in Argentina expressed concern at the accusation. “We are very worried,” said Amia’s president, Leonardo Jmelnitzky. “We really did not expect something like this.”Nisman said his accusations were based on phone taps on close allies of Fernández, who he said conspired in a “sophisticated criminal plan” to negotiate with Rabbani himself. In exchange for the “oil for grains” deal, Argentina would cancel an international Interpol arrest warrant against Rabbani and other senior Iranian officials.“Iran was Argentina’s main buyer and now it’s buying almost nothing,” the prosecutor quotes Rabbani as saying in an intercepted 2013 telephone conversation with an Iranian link who had contact with Fernández allies in Buenos Aires.“That could change. Here [in Iran] there are some sectors of the government who’ve told me they are willing to sell oil to Argentina … and also to buy weapons.”In 2013, Argentina signed a controversial agreement with Iran to set up a joint commission to investigate the blast. Nisman claims that deal was a direct result of the “oil for grains” secret deal that he alleges Fernández sought.In that memorandum, Iran agreed to set up a truth commission on the bombing in return for Argentina closing down the judicial investigation and cancelling the Interpol warrants while the commission worked.The agreement, which was roundly condemned by Jewish community leaders, was approved by Argentina’s Congress but foundered after Iran failed to confirm it, apparently because the Interpol warrants were not lifted in time.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/15/technology-no-magic-solution-bulk-data-collection-panel,"Technology offers no magic solution to bulk data collection issues, says panel",Advisory body says ‘technological magic’ cannot resolve security objectives and privacy concerns about phone records and details of other communications,"No “technological magic” can reconcile the security objectives and privacy concerns sparked by the National Security Agency’s bulk collection of communications data, an academic advisory panel reported on Thursday.Convened by the US director of national intelligence, James Clapper, in response to a request from President Barack Obama, the panel did not specifically endorse any bulk collection conducted by the NSA on Americans’ phone records and international communications and foreigners’ emails, phone calls and internet searches.Instead, the panel, heavy on computer science experts under the aegis of the National Academy of Sciences, rejected the idea that technology can resolve what 18 months’ worth of policy debate over surveillance, sparked by the intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden, have not.Examining a range of technical alternatives to bulk data collection, the panel concluded that none can fully replicate its primary potential investigative value: identifying new intelligence targets in the future from a massive pool of previously collected information.“A choice to eliminate all forms of bulk collection would have its costs in intelligence capabilities,” the panel concluded, though it neither cited real-world cases nor assessed the efficacy of bulk surveillance in practice.But the panel suggested that narrowing the parameters of what intelligence agencies seek to investigate would reduce the utility of bulk data for cases in which old information is unimportant. It likened bulk data collection to “telephone directories”, providing intelligence analysts with reference material for additional investigation, not necessarily usable threat information.“It is the context of the investigation, rather than the technique for using collected metadata, that most influences the value of bulk collection,” the panel found.Shunting away policy and legal questions but mindful of the unresolved privacy debate, the panel looked favorably on additional and automated safeguards on the use of collected data by intelligence analysts. However, judges on the secret surveillance court overseeing the NSA have found the agency to have misrepresented how its automated querying functions actually operate.“Technical means can isolate collected data and automatically restrict queries that analysts make, and the way that these means work can be public without revealing sources and methods,” the panel judged.Clapper convened the panel after Obama’s January 2014 directive constraining the NSA’s analysis of domestic bulk phone data. A component of the directive encouraged exploring “the feasibility of creating software that would allow the Intelligence Community more easily to conduct targeted information acquisition rather than bulk collection”.Since the Guardian and other news organizations began publishing Snowden’s revelations, the intelligence agencies have portrayed bulk surveillance as a stark binary choice: either collect everyone’s data, or accept catastrophic terrorist attacks as inevitable. In August 2013, a senior US intelligence official, who would not speak for the record, told reporters that the NSA had no technical alternatives to collecting screengrabs of email inboxes, even though emails from legally protected US persons would be visible.As acknowledged by the panel, a different advisory body, the government’s Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, found that in practice, the bulk collection of US domestic phone records did not prevent any terrorist attacks, and recommended shuttering the program. The same board found that the NSA’s bulk collection of foreigners’ communications and Americans’ international conversations was effective against terrorism, though its chairman said the program walked “right up to the line of constitutionality”.The NSA and the Obama administration have stopped defending the necessity of bulk collection of US phone data, following a political uproar after Snowden revealed it. But a bill aimed at making the phone companies and not the NSA the repository of the call data failed last year, leaving surveillance reform with an uncertain future in the current Congress. The legal authority undergirding the ongoing bulk collection of US call records expires in June.Mark Rumold, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the report’s assessment of bulk collection ought to have come before US intelligence began the practice in secret, even if its technical assessments were agnostic on policy recommendations.“If what you’re trying to do is re-create past events, there’s no computer program that you can create that will substitute for that. They rightfully note that it’s a policy decision, whether or not the need to re-create past events is worth the tradeoff for citizens’ privacy,” Rumold said.The panel also found that government’s definitions of “bulk” and “targeted” surveillance were often at odds with “the plain meaning of the words bulk and targeted”, as “with a broad discriminant such as ‘Syria’, collection is targeted”.Additionally, the panel suggested that surveillance would inevitably expand beyond traditional communications platforms, and into networked, internet-accessible home appliances like Nest’s Wi-Fi enabled thermostat.“In the committee’s view, [signals intelligence] has come to embrace almost any data stored on an electronic device. In a future that contains the Internet of Things, the scope will be even greater,” it found.",Thu 15 Jan 2015 23.42 GMT,"['Surveillance', 'NSA', 'news']"

On the other hand the church has very clearly asked me to choose between my conscience and censoring myself – and if given the choice between my conscience and staying silent, I want to treat my conscience.”He said that the prospect of actual excommunication held little meaning for him. “In June my family and I stopped attending church, and we’ve been very happy since,” he said. “As far as the work goes, I’m even more committed to alleviating suffering within Mormonism than I’ve ever been.”In a press release, Dehlin said he had begun to discover “troubling and hard-to-find” facts about the Mormon church after being called to serve as an early-morning seminary teacher while working for Microsoft in Washington state.He said he spent “several depressed years trying to reconcile these facts with the church that I loved (and still love)”, and that he started the Mormon Stories podcast as a way to deal with those issues.Dehlin said his work on the podcast had made him the subject of “at least three” formal investigations by the Mormon church. He also said King had told him at a meeting in August last year that in order to avoid church discipline, he would have to censor or remove all past episodes of his podcast that were not favorable to the church and agree never to interview anyone for the podcast who expressed doubt or criticism of the church.He could also never again voice public doubt or criticism of the church, he was told, and he would have to cease his public support of same-sex marriage and the Ordain Women movement.In a letter dated 10 August, Dehlin told King he would not agree to those terms.Dehlin said that while he would rather the church leadership left him alone, he would “rather face excommunication than disavow my moral convictions”.A spokesperson for the Church of the Latter-Day Saints told the Guardian: “We respect the privacy of individuals, and don’t publicly discuss the reasons why a member faces Church discipline. Those reasons are provided to a member by their local Church leaders. It’s my understanding that in this case the reasons have been clearly spelled out in letters to John Dehlin. In the interest of honesty and transparency, he may choose to make those letters public.”",Thu 15 Jan 2015 22.44 GMT,"['Mormonism', 'Religion', 'LGBTQ+ rights', 'news']"

All parties should take note that Queenslanders want them to step up their commitments to the Reef.“Concern about the future of the Great Barrier Reef is so high that traditional election issues like health, education and jobs have been pushed down the list.”Labor candidate for Mount Coot-tha, Steven Miles, who had told Guardian Australia a week before the poll that he had encountered a striking level of concern about the reef while campaigning, said he was “not surprised” by the results.“I’ve been door knocking since April (last year) and people have well-informed concerns: they’re across the effect of dredging, they’re across the run off effect and of course they’re aware of the wider challenge of climate change,” he said.Sitting LNP member Saxon Rice holds Mount Coot-tha by a margin of 5.4%.",Thu 15 Jan 2015 22.25 GMT,"['Queensland election 2015', 'Great Barrier Reef', 'Brisbane', 'Queensland', 'Queensland politics', 'news']"

Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Turkey have banned the new issue of the magazine.In one cartoon on a popular Arabic-language news website, a European-looking man has a viper emerging from his mouth under the heading: “Anti-Muslim”. In the adjacent image, entitled “Anti-semitism”, the same man’s mouth is closed by a padlock bearing a Star of David.Attacks on Israel often feature prominently in Arab cartoons and this episode has prompted a flurry of them. Emad Hajjaj, a popular Jordanian cartoonist, drew an elderly Palestinian woman by her sagging UN tent saying – in an untranslatable pun on the words “Charlie” and the colloquial Arabic “I have been” – that she had lived as a refugee for the 67 years since the creation of Israel in 1948. “Shame on you” declares an Egyptian peasant in Hisham al-Shamaly’s cartoon about last weekend’s Paris solidarity rally, with Israel’s prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu in the front row of marching world leaders. Another caricaturist portrayed Netanyahu heading for the event with angling gear, saying he was planning an outing to “fish in muddy waters”.A Turkish cartoonist showed Netanyahu spreading out a red carpet to welcome French Jews to emigrate to an embattled, fortress-like Israel.Arab leaders are also in the frame over their responses. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, has been shown laying a wreath on the graves of the Charlie Hebdo victims but ignoring the unknown “martyrs” of last summer’s Gaza war.Al-Jazeera Arabic on Thursday ran a cartoon by Ahmed Rahma (pictured above) showing an Arab ruler heading for the French capital carrying an “I am Charlie” placard while behind him journalists and photographers languish in a cage, a corpse at their feet.The king of Jordan and the foreign ministers of Egypt, Algeria and Turkey participated in the Paris march, as did a minister from Saudi Arabia. Morocco said it had declined to take part.But the new Charlie Hebdo depiction of the Prophet Muhammad - shedding a tear and saying “all is forgiven” - has prompted fresh criticism. Egypt’s Dar al-Ifta, which is responsible for issuing religious edicts, denounced it as “an act unjustifiably provocative to the feelings of a billion and a half Muslims worldwide who love and respect the prophet”. Al-Azhar, the Sunni Muslim world’s leading centre of Islamic learning, called on Muslims to “ignore the nasty frivolity” of the latest edition. In the Gulf state of Qatar Al-Arab’s latest cartoon was captioned: “Journalism is not a crime and I am not Charlie.”In Algeria, al-Shorouk printed a cartoon of a man carrying an “I am Charlie” placard next to a tank that has run over signs for Palestine, Mali, Gaza, Iraq and Syria. It was captioned: “We are all Muhammad.” In Jordan, the minister of Muslim endowments and Islamic affairs said he had been misquoted in a report claiming that he had called on all Arab and Muslim countries to boycott French products, explaining that there were many peaceful ways to denounce the cartoons.",Thu 15 Jan 2015 22.19 GMT,"['Charlie Hebdo attack', 'Charlie Hebdo', 'Newspapers & magazines', 'France', 'Magazines', 'Freedom of speech', 'Islam', 'news']"

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/16/south-korea-teachers-exams-education,"Fast earners: South Korea’s millionaire, celebrity schoolteachers",Obsessive ‘cram school’ education culture has given some tutors pop-star profiles and wealthy lifestyles,"Clasping his headphones and closing his eyes as he sang into the studio microphone while performing a peppy duet with one of South Korea’s hottest actresses, spiky-haired Cha Kil-yong looked every bit the K-pop star.But Cha is not a singer or actor. No, he’s a unique kind of South Korean celebrity: a teaching star. And the song he was singing with Clara, a Korean mega-celebrity, in an MTV-style music video? It was called “SAT jackpot!”In this education-obsessed country, Cha is a top-ranked maths teacher. But he doesn’t teach in a school. He runs an online hagwon – or cram school – called SevenEdu that focuses entirely on preparing students to take the SAT-equivalent college entrance exam in mathematics.Teaching pays: Cha said he earned $8m last year. “I’m madly in love with maths,” he said, looking the height of trendiness in his crimson shirt and trousers and tweed jacket, in his office in Gangnam – a wealthy part of Seoul famous for its conspicuous consumption and featured in the song Gangnam Style.It’s hard to exaggerate the premium South Korea places on education. This is a society in which you have to get into the right kindergarten, so that you can get into the right elementary school, then into the right middle school and high school, and finally into the right college. Which, of course, gets you the right job and scores you the right spouse.There’s even a phrase to describe the Korean version of a helicopter mother: chima baram – literally skirt wind, to describe the swish as a mother rushes into the classroom to demand a front-row seat for her child or to question grades.Many Korean families split and live on opposite sides of the world in pursuit of a better education: the mother and children live in the United States or another English-speaking country, the better to secure entry to a prestigious university (preferably Harvard). The “goose father” continues working in South Korea, flying in to visit when he can.All of this combines to make South Korea’s equivalent of the SAT the most important event in a young person’s life.The vast majority of teenagers attend normal classes by day but go to hagwons for after-hours study. Increasingly, online hagwons are replacing traditional brick-and-mortar cram schools. The hagwons have become a $20bn industry.Masks and props used by Cha in his SevenEdu filming studio in Seoul.This devotion to studying is credited with helping South Korea rank at the top of the developed world in reading, maths and science, although the latest rankings [PDF] from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development also show that Korean students come last when asked whether they are happy at school. South Korea also has the highest suicide rate in the developed world, which many suggest is related to a high-stress focus on test scores.Some politicians and educators are questioning whether things have got out of hand. But even parents opposed to this punishing system find it difficult to opt out – their children complain that they can’t keep up if they don’t go to a hagwon.That’s good news for instructors like Cha, who started teaching at a hagwon to pay his way through his PhD programme.About 300,000 students take his online class at any given time, paying $39 for a 20-hour course (traditional cram schools charge as much as $600 for a course). He teaches them tricks for taking the timed exams, including shortcuts that students can take to solve a problem faster.Asked what makes him stand out as an instructor, Cha said: “Suppose you give the same ingredients to 100 different chefs. They would make different dishes even though they’re working with the same ingredients. It’s the same with a maths class. Even though it’s all maths and all in Korean, you can use different ingredients to come up with different results.”His studio is set up with a green chalkboard and desks, and behind the camera are piles of props – including hippo and Batman masks and a gold-sequined jacket.“You’re not only teaching a subject, you also have to be a multi-talented entertainer,” said Cha, declining to give his age and offering only that he’d been working for 20 years.On SAT day, he visits schools to offer encouragement to test takers. He also does television ads, endorsing products such as a red ginseng drink meant to boost brain power.Kwon Kyu-ho, a top-ranked literature teacher, also appears with K-pop stars and has a lucrative side business in celebrity endorsements, lending his name to a chair meant to help people study better.Maintaining his position doesn’t require just good lessons. Kwon, 33, also gets regular facials and works out, and he said some teachers even have stylists.“I always wanted to be a teacher, but I feel that regular school teaching has its limits. There is a certain way you have to teach,” said Kwon, whose lessons appear on the sites Etoos and VitaEdu. “And, of course, I’m making a lot more money this way.”He wouldn’t disclose how much he earned, only that it was “several millions” of dollars a year. The secret of his success, Kwon said, was finding the parts of tests that make most students stumble. He focuses lessons on those problem areas.This style of education has its upsides, he said.“I think one of the benefits of private education is that teachers compete with each other and try to develop higher quality content,” he said. “We have money. We can invest in ways that normal schoolteachers cannot.”As President Park Geun-hye promotes a “creative economy” as the key to taking South Korea to the next level in its development, many analysts say the country would do well to take a more creative approach to education.Lee Ju-ho, former minister of education, is among them.“All this late-night study could lead to problems in enhancing their other skills, like character, creativity and critical thinking,” he said. “Hagwon is all about rote learning and memorisation.”Lee said all the problems stem from the college admissions procedures, which have been slow in looking beyond test scores to other criteria such as extracurricular activities and personal essays, as is common in many western countries.“We really need to change,” said Lee, who is now a professor at the Korea Development Institute’s School of Public Policy and Management.This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from the Washington Post",Fri 16 Jan 2015 22.59 GMT,"['South Korea', 'Asia Pacific', 'Teaching', 'K-pop', 'features']"

As many as 1 million people lined his route from the airport on Thursday. Mobile phone reception was jammed as a security precaution.Sunday’s rally in Rizal park could draw a record papal crowd if, as expected, it eclipses the 5 million who turned out to see John Paul II in 1995. So intense is the security effort that traffic police have reportedly been issued with adult nappies to ensure that nothing deflects them from their task.The contraception comments did not represent a departure from the pontiff’s earlier statements, but Francis has traditionally sought to steer discussions away from the most divisive social issues and has been seen as less judgmental than his predecessor, Benedict XVI.The remarks were seen as a direct response to a health law that was signed in the Philippines in 2013 by President Benigno Aquino.The legislation, which was opposed by local Catholic officials, established sex education for schoolchildren and adults and also subsidised birth control for women.Earlier in the day, a meeting between the pontiff and the president at the presidential palace included a striking criticism of local church officials by Aquino as Pope Francis looked on. The president accused the officials of remaining silent in the face of abuses by former political administrations.“Some members of the clergy now seem to think that the way to be true to the faith means finding something to criticise, even to the extent that one prelate admonished me to do something about my hair, as if it were a mortal sin,” Aquino said, according to a report in the New York Times.It was a reference to remarks made by an archbishop who, in 2012, recommended that the balding president wear a wig.On Saturday, the pope is due to fly to the island of Leyte, which was devastated by a typhoon in 2013.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/17/greek-elections-syriza-europe-eurozone-alexis-tsipras,Greek elections: Syriza’s young radicals plot a political earthquake for Europe,"Inside its smoke-filled HQ, Helena Smith sees the far-left party making plans to defy the EU over Greece’s debt and abolish draconian austerity measures imposed to shore up the euro. But first it must win next Sunday’s general election","An air of excitement pervades the headquarters of Greece’s far-left Syriza party. In small, smoke-filled rooms, off corridors plastered with posters advertising Marxist seminars and cluttered with coffee cups and leftover meals, staff pore over computers. Most are women, young and intense, cigarettes dangling from lips as they tap into keyboards. The hubbub of chatter is loud. Up narrow staircases people zoom this way and that. For the visitor there is no mistaking that the seven-storey building, overlooking one of Athens’s more rundown squares, is as much a place of workable chaos as it is a well of expectancy.“Hope is coming,” proclaims a poster pinned to the noticeboards of almost every floor. “Greece is progressing, Europe is changing.”“Welcome to Syriza,” says Panos Skourletis, the party’s grey-haired spokesman, proffering a guided tour of the offices’ newly renovated media room, “and please forgive the smoke.”Barely a week before critical elections in a country once again caught up in the eurozone storm, Skourletis is buoyant. It is easy to see why. With every poll giving Syriza an indisputable lead, the radicals are on a roll. For Europe’s growing class of anti-austerians, victory is in sight. “We are going to win,” he enthuses somewhat triumphantly. “There is only one question, and that is by how much.”If bookies in Athens are to be believed, the odds on the party securing an outright majority are still slim. But, says Skourletis, as the election campaign enters its final stretch things are looking up. “On the basis of data and empirical evidence, we believe we are going to get more and more votes from the undecided, because that is how it has worked for parties in the lead in the past.”The leftwingers are not alone in taking note of the Greek electorate’s ballot-box intentions. From Westminster to Washington, Madrid to Rome, the 25 January poll is being seen as a potential watershed in the eurozone crisis. If the radicals are catapulted to power, their victory will resonate beyond Greece, reviving fears of Athens being led to the euro exit door.David Cameron and his prime ministerial counterparts in Spain and Portugal, who face electorates themselves later this year, are watching closely. So, too, are mandarins in Brussels and Berlin.From maverick marginals, the leftwingers have moved to centre stage, riding high on opposition to the austerity Athens has been forced to apply in return for €240bn in emergency bailout funds from the EU and International Monetary Fund. Their ascent poses the biggest threat to consensus politics in decades. Alexis Tsipras, Syriza’s firebrand leader, has promised to take an axe to the nexus of interests that have kept Greece’s rotten establishment alive – starting with the media-owning oligarchs who control so much of the country’s internal debate.“The future has already begun,” he declared after parliament’s failure to elect a president triggered a constitutional provision for early elections.Shock, anger and fear have marked Greece’s financial meltdown. But five years on, Syriza’s meteoric rise – and imminent electoral victory – also presages the passage of despair. Many Greeks will be inclined to vote for the insurgents as much out of hopelessness as helplessness.“With our country’s economic crisis, our big opening has been to the decimated middle class,” Skourletis says. “In us they have found a voice.”The radicals have come a long way from the time I would visit their headquarters back in the early 1990s.Then, conversation inevitably focused on intra-party disputes between Eurocommunists and the Stalinist KKE. Over tiny cups of Turkish coffee – gleefully provided as guests were so rare – Leonidas Kyrkos, the late Eurocommunist leader, would speak of the scandal-ridden nation’s need for “catharsis, ” amid warnings of its tendency to overspend, but bemoan the fact that his utopian views were shared by so few. That he would have a successor, who would emerge from school sit-ins and the anti-globalisation movement to be embraced not only by Greeks but the entire spectrum of Europe’s left, would undoubtedly have mystified him.In many ways Skourletis personifies the tectonic shift. The son of a public-sector doctor, and owner of a successful company importing tools before the crisis hit, he has seen many of his friends destroyed by the fate that has befallen Greece.“Like Greeks all over, they availed themselves of the loans that the banks were giving out so freely to buy houses and cars and, then, suddenly found themselves unemployed,” he says, wincing. “Because they are in their 50s, they are unlikely to ever work again, which means they have no prospect of getting a pension either. It’s tragic.”Activists watch an interview with Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras newspaper at the party’s election centre in Athens last week. Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty ImagesPrecisely because it has been untested by power, Syriza has also been able to count on the support of a younger generation disproportionately hit by job losses.In the absence of open revolt, the anti-establishment party is regarded as the best form of resistance to policies that have caused a Depression-era recession, worse, analysts say, even than that suffered by the United States in the 1930s.Although the Greek economy has begun to show the first signs of recovery – the result of rigorous efforts to balance the books by prime minister Antonis Samaras’s outgoing coalition – the effects of such momentous fiscal adjustment have been catastrophic.GDP has contracted by more than a quarter, around 26% of the population remains out of work, and more than three million live on, or below, the poverty line. Tsipras, last week, likened the measures to “fiscal waterboarding”.The appetite of Greeks for yet more drama is limited. Almost six years after the country was forced to come clean on the scale of its public spending, they are worn out by relentless cuts and tax rises and are visibly fatigued. Greece itself has been hollowed out. Athens, home to almost half of its 12 million-strong population, has become a casebook study of what happens to capitals when they go broke, its smashed pavements, unkempt parks, boarded up shops and ever multiplying beggars and homeless the tell-tale signs of its financial collapse.In such a climate, Tsipras’s promise of a public spending spree has gone down well. Across the board, Greeks have welcomed his pledge to tackle the country’s “silent humanitarian crisis” by increasing the minimum wage, reducing taxes and hiring in the public sector. But the euphoria that accompanied past political sea-changes is unlikely to be evident. Many say they will be rooting for Syriza out of protest against the centre-right New Democracy and the centre-left Pasok, the two mainstream parties that, alternating in power for the past 40 years, have been blamed for Greece’s near economic death.Aware that the vast majority want to remain in the eurozone, Tsipras, who turned 40 last year, has toned down his anti-European rhetoric. Gone are the references to “tearing up” the memoranda of conditions attached to the country’s rescue programmes. Last week he went out of his way to placate German taxpayers, saying that they had “nothing to fear from a Syriza government”.“Our aim is not for a confrontation with our partners, to get more credits or a licence for new deficits,” he wrote in the economic daily Handelsblatt. “It is to stabilise the country, reach a balanced primary budget and end the bloodletting from German and Greek taxpayers.”But the charismatic politician still says he has “Merkelism” in his sights. Ending austerity and writing off Athens’s monumental debt – at 177% of GDP the largest in Europe – remain priorities. And with creditors ruling out both, analysts say it will require a major kolotumba, or U-turn, on the part of the leader to avert a head-on collision. Earlier this month the European Central Bank added to the pressure with a stark warning that Greek lenders would be unable to tap funds if bailout conditions were dropped, raising the spectre of a bank run in the months ahead.A free meal organised by the Athens municipality for elderly, homeless and needy people last Easter. Photograph: Panayiotis Tzamaros/Demotix/Corbis“Tsipras is entrapped in his own rhetoric,” says Dr Eleni Panagiotarea, a research fellow at Eliamep, Greece’s leading thinktank. “To move from where he is now to pulling off the kolotumba will not only mean a loss of prestige but control over the various far-left factions in his party and, if that happens, it is going to be very difficult for him to get his own MPs to vote through legislation in the future.”Maoists, Trotskyists, anti-capitalist activists and champagne-swilling ex-trade unionists, who once belonged to the socialist Pasok party, are among the 11 groups that are part of Syriza. At least 30% are militants who openly advocate dumping the euro in favour of the drachma. Tsipras moved up the ranks through Synaspismos, the Eurocommunist party that forms the alliance’s central plank. If he controls 60% of the MPs who are likely to be elected next Sunday, insiders say it would be a “huge achievement”.“He is faced with a huge dilemma,” says Spyros Lykoudis, who spent more than 20 years in Synaspismos before abandoning the party in disagreement over the need to press ahead with reforms. “If he placates creditors abroad, he stands to lose his own constituency and if he doesn’t he risks bankruptcy.”Lykoudis, who is now running with To Potami, a centrist party established last year, believes the best solution would lie in the formation of a coalition government.“And our hope is that it is us who emerges as the country’s third biggest force and not the neo-Nazis in Golden Dawn,” he adds. “If reformers are in his government, it will act as a restraint and make it easier to take measures. As things stand, he is a populist who promises all things to all men.”The charge that Syriza is composed of dangerous ideologues bent on turning Greece into a Marxist paradise is heartedly rebuffed by cadres.Instead the leftwingers argue that the centre of gravity in politics has shifted so much to the right since the advent of Thatcherism that the party’s proposals now seem radical. “All the things that sound radical now were standard fare in the golden age of capitalism in the 50s and 60s,” says the economics professor Euclid Tsakalotos, Syriza’s shadow finance minister for the last two years.Raised in Britain and educated at St Paul’s, the leading London private school, before going to Oxford, Tsakalotos, 54, insists that after years of being subjected to the brutal vagaries of the market, there are growing numbers across Europe who feel excluded from decision-making and the centres of power.“We are only more radical in the sense that we have been influenced by the anti-global movement and believe in concepts of participatory democracy,” he adds. “The angst Syriza has caused is down to us challenging a system that can’t actually represent the interests of ordinary people.”In the party’s smoke-filled headquarters, the leftwingers say they are gearing up for a fight. This is the closest they have come to power since the formation, almost 200 years ago, of the modern Greek state, and they are not going to surrender easily.“Unlike the left elsewhere, we stopped arguing about Trotsky and Stalin and managed to bury our differences,” says the soft-spoken Christoforos Papadopoulos, a member of the party’s political secretariat. “That has been the secret of our success, and you can be sure that when we reach office we are not going to betray what we believe in.”When the going gets tough, it is likely that Syriza will focus on clamping down on oligarchs and other vested interests to get by. One US cable, revealed by WikiLeaks, described the tycoons as “a small group of people who have made or inherited fortunes …  and who are related by blood, marriage or adultery to political and government officials and/or other media and business magnates.”“What we will not be doing is making any kolotumbes,” says Papadopoulos, taking a mighty draw on his umpteenth cigarette.A homeless man eats in the doorway of a closed shop in Athens. Photograph: Thanassis Stavrakis/APSYRIZA’S PROMISESThe party aims to end austerity by: ■ Giving free electricity to Greeks whose supplies have been cut off; ■ Providing food stamps to children; ■ Giving health care to the uninsured; ■ Providing a roof for the homeless; ■ Raising the minimum wage to €750 a month from under €500; ■ Introducing a moratorium on private debt repayments to banks above 30% of disposable income.In addition, Syriza says it will call for Greece’s “unsustainable” €320bn euro debt load to be drastically reduced and interest repayments cut. It wants an international conference to be held on the issue in an echo of the treatment given Germany after the second world war.It also wants to abolish the economic privileges enjoyed by the Greek Orthodox church and shipping industry, reduce military spending, raise taxes on big companies and set a 75% tax on incomes over €500,000.",Sat 17 Jan 2015 22.49 GMT,"['Greece', 'The Observer', 'Eurozone crisis', 'Economics', 'European Union', 'Europe', 'Euro', 'European banks', 'features']"

Five died and 45 were injured in clashes on Friday in Niger’s second largest city, Zinder, where a French cultural centre and cafe were also hit.The majority of Niger’s 17 million population is Muslim, but the country is also home to many Christians. Last year, the United Nations declared the land-locked country north of Nigeria the poorest nation on earth.As protesters in Niamey burned the French flag, and the embassy there urged French citizens to stay at home, France’s president, François Hollande, reiterated his country’s commitment to freedom of expression.“I’m thinking of countries where sometimes they don’t understand what freedom of expression is because they have been deprived of it. But also, we have supported these countries in their fight against terrorism,” said Hollande, on a visit to Tulle, central France.The flare-up on the edge of the Sahara desert was the most violent of a string of protests across the Muslim world at the weekend, all denouncing the magazine’s cover. It showed a weeping Muhammad carrying a sign saying, “I am Charlie” under the words: “All is forgiven”.A week earlier, two gunmen had shot dead 12 journalists, workers and police at the offices of the satirical magazine, claiming that the attacks were “avenging the prophet” for past insults.In Niger, the killings were denounced by Muslims horrified that their faith had been hijacked by terrorists, but few were happy with the Charlie Hebdo response either. Most Muslims believe Muhammad should not be depicted, and find satirical cartoons particularly offensive.From Khartoum to Russia’s Muslim North Caucasus, and across the west African countries of Mali, Senegal and Mauritania, crowds took to the streets in peaceful demonstrations after Friday prayers. In Algiers and the Jordanian capital, Amman, though, protesters clashed with police, and in Pakistan and Niger there was serious violence.In the Pakistani port city of Karachi city, police battled activists from the Jamaat-e-Islami party, who were trying to enter the French consulate. Television cameras captured some brandishing guns, as police fired in the air and doused the crowd with water cannon. At least three people were injured, including AFP photographer Asif Hassan.The rioters in Niger set up roadblocks, attacked a police station and burned two police cars, after police banned a meeting called by Islamic leaders and arrested four imams. Another protest march has been called for Sunday.“They offended our prophet Muhammad. That’s what we didn’t like,” Amadou Abdoul Ouahab, a demonstrator, told Reuters. “This is the reason why we have asked Muslims to come, so that we can explain this to them, but the state refused. That’s why we’re angry today.”Some people carried signs saying: “I am not Charlie”, denouncing the slogan of solidarity with the magazine.The group tore up bibles inside churches, ransacked bars, hotels and businesses under non-Muslim ownership or linked to France, including telephone kiosks run by Orange.“As soon as the protesters started towards the grand mosque we knew this was coming,” Kiema Soumaila, manager of Niamey’s Toulousain bar, told AFP. “They burned everything after smashing anything that was glass on the road.”The rampage targeted seven evangelical churches in Niamey, where riot police got ready to protect the cathedral.“Some of us stayed barricaded in our homes. I have never been so scared in my life,” said one onlooker, a Christian mechanic. “The government must put a stop to this. It doesn’t look good for us.”",Sat 17 Jan 2015 22.24 GMT,"['Niger', 'The Observer', 'Africa', 'Charlie Hebdo attack', 'news']"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/17/isis-uk-female-jihadists-database-icsr,"Isis using UK female jihadis to incite terror acts back home, say researchers",Intensive monitoring of social media accounts of female Britons based in northern Syria reveals women’s key new role,"A hardcore of British women who have travelled to Syria to join Islamic State (Isis) are encouraging other women in the UK to carry out terrorist attacks back home, the Observer has learned.The role of British female jihadists in inciting terrorism in the UK has been uncovered by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) at King’s College London, which has identified a group of around 30 female Britons based in northern Syria.According to monitoring of their social media accounts, a number have been acting as Isis recruiters or openly praising the Charlie Hebdo shootings, while encouraging more bloodshed, including the beheadings of westerners.Until now, the western women joining Isis have largely been portrayed as passive – travelling to marry jihadists and bear their children away from the frontline. But as police across the UK prepare for possible attacks against them and with Europe on high alert following arrests of suspected Islamist militants in Belgium, France and Germany, the ICSR work shows that many such women are part of the escalating threat.Melanie Smith, research fellow at the ICSR and the person in charge of the first known database of female foreign fighters, said: “British women tend to incite [attacks], they say to people that can’t move to the Islamic State: ‘Why not carry out something at home?’ That’s a common message: if you can’t leave your family behind or afford to move to Syria then carry out something.”Information from the database, which has details of 70 women, the youngest a French 15-year-old, suggests the portrayal of women as merely providing support and children for male fighters is becoming increasingly outdated.Smith said: “I don’t think anyone talks about women returning as a risk. While they might not have the same military training, you can see women online being frustrated about the fact they can’t fight and they suggest to each other that they could do something else. Women historically have been used in suicide bombings and singular operations.”The ICSR, which is run by Professor Peter Neumann, observed a spike in social media activity following the Paris shootings, with researchers identifying a significant number of UK women praising the attacks in Paris. Among them was a 16-year-old from Manchester who celebrated the shootings on Twitter, while another British woman greeted the Charlie Hebdo shootings by saying: “May Allah help them kill as many kafirs they can #parisshooting.”Another potential name to be added to the ICSR database is Hayat Boumeddiene, partner of one of the Paris attackers, Amédy Coulibaly, and France’s most wanted woman.David Cameron, who is in Washington on a two-day trip, told the CBS political show Face the Nation that Britain now faced a “very severe threat”, adding that an attack was “highly likely”. While the prime minister insisted he and President Barack Obama had made significant progress in talks on how to counter international terrorism, he acknowledged that it would be a long struggle.“I think the reason some people are concerned about this strategy is that perhaps we haven’t said enough about how long it is going to take to work,” he said. He conceded that “it is going to take a very long time to deal with this”, because the answer lay in having strong governments and security forces in Iraq and Syria.The UK government and US secretary of state John Kerry will welcome foreign ministers from around 20 countries to Lancaster House in London on Thursday for a day of talks on how to combat the threat of Isis. Discussions will focus on the military campaign, Isis’s financing, foreign fighters, strategic communications and humanitarian assistance.But as Cameron stressed the importance of the UK’s “special relationship” with the US, diplomats and pro-EU politicians expressed concern that the UK was in danger of isolating itself from the EU at the very time when European nations needed to work together.Lord Hannay, the former UK ambassador to the EU and the UN, who chaired a House of Lords committee on the UK’s involvement in EU justice and home affairs issues, said that the UK would be “out in the cold” in terms of European cooperation in the fight against terrorism if it had not opted back in to EU measures such as the European arrest warrant – or if it were to leave the EU after the referendum promised by Cameron in 2015.The crossbench peer, who now advises the cross-party group British Influence, which campaigns to keep the UK inside a reformed EU, said that if Eurosceptics had got their way last year, pulling the UK out of most EU police and justice cooperation, it would have left the country more exposed. “Just think where we would be today, in the midst of a major threat to European democracies if we had not opted back in on 1 December … We would be out in the cold and more at risk. Absolutely.”In Greece anti-terror police were interrogating four suspected jihadis, including the alleged mastermind of the cell that was dismantled in Belgium on Thursday, following their arrest in Athens.Officials were also examining logs of their mobile phones found in their city centre apartment. Greek security forces have long expressed fears of jihadis infiltrating the country. Earlier on Saturday, Belgian state broadcasters said authorities were seeking a Brussels man of Moroccan origin who was hiding in Greece.",Sat 17 Jan 2015 21.35 GMT,"['Islamic State', 'The Observer', 'UK security and counter-terrorism', 'Syria', 'David Cameron', 'Charlie Hebdo attack', 'news']"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/18/egypt-cotton-industry-farmers-subsidy-decline,Egyptian cotton hangs by thread after state subsidy axed,"Low global price exacerbates decline of country’s most famous product, with many farmers moving to different crops","It is the pride of linen departments around the world. Yet depending on who you believe, the days of Egyptian cotton – the source of what some see as the softest and most durable bedsheets on the market – may be numbered.According to farmers in Egypt, the government’s recent decision to end subsidies for cotton growers sounded the death knell for an already declining industry. They say the subsidy was the difference between breaking even and making a loss.“The margin is very low and, with no subsidy, I think that no farmer will grow cotton any more,” said Gamal Siam, a cotton farmer, agricultural economist at Cairo University and former adviser to Egypt’s agriculture ministry. “This is the end of Egyptian cotton.”Farmers of Egypt’s 300,000 feddans (126,000 hectares) of cotton make about 6,000EGP (£550) per feddan. Most of that goes on labour and other costs, meaning the aid, worth 1,400EGP per feddan, is what keeps farmers afloat. “They are actually having problems even with the subsidy,” said Osama al-Khouli, co-founder of Egypt’s independent farmers’ union. “What will happen when they remove it?”Since the early 90s, when the government finally allowed the price of Egyptian cotton to be dictated by global markets, the sector has been in slow decline. Two decades ago, Egyptian growers produced up to 400,000 tonnes of cotton lint; last year, that figure had dropped to 127,000, according to Terry Townsend, former executive director of the International Cotton Advisory Committee, an intra-governmental body. “By 2020, my forecasts are that Egypt will be producing 60,000 tonnes,” he said. “It’s not going to be zero, but Egypt is a very urban country, and cotton is just not the best use of its land. Other crops have a better economic return than cotton does.”Farmers such as Khouli have given up cotton growing, while Siam said the removal of this year’s subsidy was the last straw for him. “Myself, I’ve decided not to grow Egyptian cotton any more,” he said. “It’s just wasting time and resources.”The government feels there is little point in propping up cotton producers at a time when the state is short of money. The global cotton price is low and Egyptian cotton mills mainly process foreign cotton fibres, which are shorter and easier to work with than the fabled local long ones.For Siam, the loss of a crop that is synonymous with his country, and which all farmers were once legally obliged to grow, is cause for sorrow: “It’s a valuable thing for me and my culture. “It’s very famous, everywhere I go in the world, everyone knows Egyptian cotton, and everyone wants something made from it.”Some in the export sector say the crisis is overblown. Ahmed el-Bosaty, president of the Alexandria Cotton Exporters Association, pointed out that the subsidy was a recent introduction anyway. There was still a chance, he said, that financial incentives would be given later in the year to mills to encourage them to buy more local cotton.“I think this has really got out of proportion,” said Bosaty, who also heads Modern Nile, one of Egypt’s biggest cotton export firms.“The default is that there is not a subsidy [to farmers].”Officials at the agriculture ministry did not respond to requests to clarify the issue.British homeware stores were reluctant to be drawn on what all this means for their linen stocks. But there is no cause for panic, says Townsend, the former ICAC director.For a start, Townsend thinks Egypt’s own cotton production will not disappear entirely. Even if it did, it would be still two years before UK felt the effects – cotton picked in late 2014 will not arrive in sheet-form on the British high street until late 2016. In any case, Egypt only provides about a sixth of the world’s high-quality, long-staple cotton.Countries including the US, India, Peru and Sudan all grow the same kind of cotton, and could pick up the slack if there was demand to do so. They would also be legally entitled to call it Egyptian cotton, said Townsend: in the 1920s, Egypt did not defend its copyright to the term. “So courts around the world ruled that ‘Egyptian cotton’ had become a generic term that referred to any cotton in this long fine form.”But back in Egypt, none of this is much consolation for the likes of Gamal Siam. “I feel very sad,” he said. “Egyptian cotton has cultural importance. They used to call it the fourth pyramid.”Additional reporting by Manu Abdo",Sun 18 Jan 2015 23.29 GMT,"['Egypt', 'Middle East and north Africa', 'Africa', 'Retail industry', 'Farming', 'news']"

The Indonesian government had “so far rebuffed our pleas” on the basis that the country was facing a drugs crisis and the death penalty was part of the law, she said.“The Australian government will continue to make representations at the highest level,” Bishop told Sky News.Bishop would not speculate on whether Australia would follow the Dutch and Brazilian governments in recalling ambassadors if Indonesia followed through with the executions.Dutch and Brazilian citizens were among six people killed by firing squad in Indonesia on Sunday.Sukumaran’s plea for clemency was rejected last month but the Indonesian president is yet to make a final decision on Chan’s request. Jakarta has indicated that if Chan’s appeal was rejected the two men would be executed together.The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said Labor stood “shoulder to shoulder” with the government in its appeal to Indonesia for clemency because both parties were opposed to the death penalty.Jimly Asshiddiqie, a former chairman of Indonesia’s constitutional court, has spoken out to challenge Jakarta’s inconsistency on capital punishment.",Sun 18 Jan 2015 22.40 GMT,"['Bali Nine', 'Julie Bishop', 'Bali', 'Indonesia', 'Asia Pacific', 'Australian politics', 'news']"

Indonesia cannot avoid this,’ says former chairman of constitutional court as fate of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran hangs in the balance","A former top Indonesian judge who had wanted to spare Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran the death penalty has challenged Jakarta’s inconsistency on capital punishment.Indonesia put one citizen and five foreign prisoners to death for drug crimes on Sunday, prompting Brazil and the Netherlands to recall their ambassadors.The two Bali Nine ringleaders could be among the next group to face the firing squad, as the president, Joko Widodo, backs another 20 executions this year as “shock therapy” to would-be drug pushers.His predecessor, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, sent five prisoners for execution in 2013, and none in the four years prior.Jimly Asshiddiqie, a former chairman of Indonesia’s constitutional court, went on the record in 2008 saying he had wanted to uphold the 2007 appeal of Chan and Sukumaran.However, at the time he believed that as the chief of the bench he should not side with the minority, and handed down a 6-3 decision.He had hoped their executions could be delayed 10 years, when the pair might find a “next generation” of constitutional court judges against the death penalty, even for drug traffickers.Now Asshiddiqie has said Jakarta has avoided confronting the issue for so long, its position is inconsistent and out of date.“It’s not right that when our workers abroad are facing the death penalty we protest against it, but when foreigners are about to face death here we don’t,” he said.“This is inconsistent. Personally, I think we must open a space where we can discuss the death penalty openly.“Global humanitarian values have changed. Indonesia cannot avoid this.”Asshiddiqie also blamed the inertia for the current legal uncertainty over the death penalty.Presidential clemency – officially denied to Sukumaran and expected to be denied to Chan – is a final appeal to be spared the death penalty. But a new legal avenue could open, depending on the interpretation of a constitutional court decision allowing prisoners to seek multiple judicial reviews.Asshiddiqie maintained there was no limit on judicial reviews, as long as the courts were being asked to consider new facts.He would not comment on whether Chan and Sukumaran should be granted a review to consider their remarkable rehabilitation in jail. But the influential figure – nominated as Globe Asia’s man of the year 2008 – did believe Indonesia should abolish the death penalty.",Sun 18 Jan 2015 21.28 GMT,"['Bali Nine', 'Indonesia', 'Bali', 'Capital punishment', 'news']"

Jakarta has taken a hardline stance against drug offenders and indicated that if Chan’s appeal was rejected the two men would be executed together.In an interview on Tuesday, Abbott said he and the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, had made “strong representations” on behalf of Sukumaran and Chan, and still hoped the Indonesian government would change its mind.“We don’t believe in the death penalty, we don’t believe in the death penalty here, we don’t believe in the death penalty abroad, if any Australians are subject to it we do what we can to avert that,” the prime minister told the Sydney radio station WSFM.“But in the end Indonesia, while it is a good and close friend of Australia, it is a sovereign country, they do have their own judicial system.“I hope that the evidence of genuine remorse, of genuine rehabilitation means that, even at this late stage, the plea for clemency might be accepted because in the end mercy has to be a part of every justice system including the Indonesian one.”Dutch and Brazilian citizens were among six people killed by firing squad in Indonesia on Sunday.Asked whether Australia would follow the Dutch and Brazilian governments in recalling ambassadors if the executions went ahead, Abbott said: “My job is to try to stop the executions going ahead and I don’t want to pre-empt what may or may not happen afterwards. As I said, I think these two are well and truly reformed characters and I hope that the Indonesians will accept that and acknowledge and act appropriately.”At a later media conference in Sydney, Abbott said he had personally raised the issue with the Indonesian president but he was “not going to go into the detail of who said what to whom and when”.

Russia called the operation a strategic mistake.Ukrainian officials said three soldiers had been killed and 66 wounded over the past 24 hours, during which they said they had returned battle lines at the airport to the status quo under a much violated international peace plan.Russia expressed concern at what it called escalation by Kiev and published its own peace plan on Monday in the form of a letter from the president, Vladimir Putin, to Ukraine’s president, Petro Poroshenko, which it said Poroshenko had rejected.“It’s the biggest, even strategic mistake of the Ukrainian authorities to bank on a military solution to the crisis,” Interfax quoted Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Grigory Karasin, as saying. “This may lead to irreversible consequences for Ukrainian statehood.”Ukrainian officials have insisted Moscow sticks to the 12-point peace plan agreed in Minsk in September, which they say was not violated by its airport counter-offensive, launched after troops had appeared to be pinned down inside the complex.Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said the situation was still very tense around the airport, which has symbolic value for both sides, and separatists continued attacks on government forces there and elsewhere in the east.A military source told Reuters that up to 25 Russian tanks had crossed the border near Luhansk.Putin’s letter called for urgent moves to withdraw large-calibre weapons from the conflict zone. “This is now an absolute priority,” said a Russian foreign ministry statement.Ukraine’s foreign ministry hit back, calling for Moscow to show its readiness to comply with the Minsk agreement by signing a timetable for implementing its main points.“It is very important that a concrete plan is signed for fulfilling all, without exception, the points of the Minsk agreements, and not just those that Russia or the terrorists like,” spokesperson Evhen Perebynis said on TV channel 112.A military spokesperson said Russia was continuing to send significant quantities of military equipment into Ukraine.The World Health Organisation says more than 4,800 people have been killed since the conflict erupted in Ukraine’s coalmining eastern territories last April.",Mon 19 Jan 2015 21.23 GMT,"['Ukraine', 'Europe', 'Russia', 'Vladimir Putin', 'World Health Organization', 'news']"

No, insists ex-wife","Alberto Nisman, who accused president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner of protecting those behind the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center, was found dead in his apartment on Monday","The ex-wife of a prosecutor who accused Argentinian president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner of protecting the masterminds of a 1994 bombing does not believe an initial finding that he killed himself on the eve of his testimony before congress.While acknowledging that investigators need time to examine the facts, judge Sandra Arroyo was clear in answering reporters who asked Tuesday whether her ex-husband’s death was a suicide.“No,” she said.Alberto Nisman, 51, was found in the bathroom of his locked apartment early Monday, a bullet wound on the right side of his head and, next to his body, a .22 caliber handgun and a single bullet casing, authorities said.Alberto Nisman’s death highlights failures of Argentinian investigationRead moreNisman had spent 10 years investigating the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, a still-unsolved attack that killed 85 people. His death came hours before he was to appear in congress to detail his accusation that Fernández, her foreign minister and other top officials had agreed to shield Iranian officials who allegedly masterminded the bombing.Administration officials dismissed the allegations as ludicrous.Viviana Fein, the lead investigator into Nisman’s death, said on Monday it appeared to be a suicide and that no indications had surfaced to suggest anyone else was involved.The gun found next to Nisman had been given to him by a colleague, she said. An initial test for gunshot residue on his hand was negative, but Fein said that was not unusual given the small caliber of the weapon.No suicide letter was found, according to an adviser to the ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press. Colleagues said they’d seen no sign he planned to kill himself.Nisman had said he’d been threatened repeatedly for his work and, at the time of his death, 10 federal police officers had been assigned to protect him. Investigators planned to question the officers, starting Tuesday with those posted outside his building the night of his death.Arroyo, who met with investigators to learn about the progress of the probe, said answers would come in due time.“There is an investigation underway. We must let justice proceed. I cannot make conjectures,” she told reporters.The 1994 bombing of the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association is considered the worst terrorist attack in Argentina’s history. In 2005, Nisman was appointed by then-president Nestor Kirchner, Fernández’s husband, to revive the floundering investigation. He requested arrest orders be issued against several Iranian officials, including a former president and foreign minister, which an Argentinian judge agreed to do in 2006. Interpol later put most of them on its most-wanted list.But the case made little progress and, in 2013, Argentina and Iran agreed to jointly investigate the attack, a move critics said was meant to undermine Nisman’s probe.Last week, Nisman asked a federal judge to call Fernández and others, including foreign minister Héctor Timerman, for questioning, accusing them of having made “the criminal decision to fabricate Iran’s innocence to sate Argentina’s commercial, political and geopolitical interests.” The judge was considering Nisman’s request.Congresswoman Cornelia Schmidt-Liermann said she had planned to pick Nisman up at his residence Monday and accompany him to congress for his testimony.“Everybody who had contact with him the last 24 hours says he was confident” about his testimony, she said. “There is no indication, under any circumstances, that he killed himself.”",Tue 20 Jan 2015 23.21 GMT,"['Argentina', 'Americas', 'Cristina Fernández de Kirchner', 'Judaism', 'Iran', 'news']"

He vowed to save the men, saying “their lives are the top priority”, but declined to say whether Japan would pay the ransom.Yukawa and Goto are the first Japanese citizens to have been threatened with execution by Islamic State.The two men were seized last year. Yukawa was captured by Isis fighters on 17 August near the town of Dabiq, north-east Syria. He is believed to have been with a Syrian opposition militia, Suqour al-Sham, at the time. Goto, meanwhile, was seized in October, after travelling to the Isis stronghold of Raqqa. Goto is a freelance journalist who runs a small media company, sourcing work from independent reporters.Yukawa, from Chiba prefecture near Tokyo, went to Syria to fight with rebels last year after a series of personal misfortunes. In the previous decade, his wife had died of cancer and he had been forced to sleep rough for a month after losing his home when his business went bankrupt. In 2013 he began spending time with Japanese far-right groups and attempted to reinvent himself as a security consultant.As the self-styled chief executive of Private Military Company, Yukawa declared himself ready to help Japanese multinationals with bases in dangerous parts of the world. There is no evidence that his company ever traded.Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe holds a news conference in Jerusalem. Photograph: AMMAR AWAD/REUTERSPictures on his Facebook page show Yukawa in Iraq and Syria in July. One video on his page showed him holding a Kalashnikov assault rifle with the caption: “Syria war in Aleppo 2014.”He once reportedly told family and friends that journeying to dangerous places, such as Syria and Somalia, represented his last chance to find personal contentment. “He felt his life had reached its limit,” his father, Shoichi, told Reuters last year after he was taken hostage.Yukawa was filmed by Isis after sustaining a leg injury during a gunfight 20 miles (30km) north of Aleppo. It appeared to show him lying on his back with blood pouring down his face. Asked if he was a soldier, he replied that he was “no soldier” and that he was “half journalist, half doctor”.Goto, an author and journalist in his late 40s, has previously said he was driven by a desire to report from trouble spots on issues that were sometimes neglected by mainstream media. He has written books on Aids and the plight of children in war zones.“I’m in Syria for reporting,” he told Associated Press in an email last October. “I hope I can convey the atmosphere from where I am and share it.”The pair are understood to have met up to travel back to the Middle East when Yukawa briefly returned to Japan in April.After Yukawa’s capture Goto told Reuters that, despite his bravado, Yukawa had a softer side that helped persuade Free Syrian Army rebels to allow him to accompany them. “Yukawa has this soft, non-threatening approach that makes people trust him and puts them at ease,” he said.Haruna YukawaAccording to the Japanese broadcaster, NHK, Goto’s family raised the alarm with the foreign ministry after he failed to return from Syria as planned in October.Both hostages are believed to be held in Raqqa, where all of the western reporters and aid workers captured so far have been taken. The jihadist group is thought to be holding two more hostages, whose identities have not been announced.By seeking $200m for the captives’ release, Isis is believed to be sending a message that it does not intend to compromise on its 72-hour deadline. Spanish and French hostages were released in 2014 after much smaller ransoms were paid by Paris and Madrid.Japan has a mixed record on paying ransoms to hostage takers because, experts say, of constitutional constraints on its ability to use force to free Japanese nationals being held overseas.In 1977, the then Japanese prime minister, Takeo Fukuda, drew accusations of caving in to terrorists when he paid a $6m ransom to Red Army members who had hijacked a Japan Airlines flight en route from Tokyo to Paris, forcing it to land in Dhaka.The threat on Tuesday came a few days after Abe pledged $200m in non-military assistance to countries fighting Isis. “Should we leave terrorism or weapons of mass destruction to spread in this region, the loss imparted upon the international community would be immeasurable,” he said last week.Japan’s top government spokesman told journalists soon after the news broke that Japan would not give in to threats from terrorists.“Our country’s stance – contributing to the fight against terrorism without giving in – remains unchanged,” Yoshihide Suga told a news conference.Abe will cut short part of his Middle East trip, but still held a summit with the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas.",Tue 20 Jan 2015 23.01 GMT,"['Islamic State', 'Japan', 'Asia Pacific', 'Syria', 'Iraq', 'Middle East and north Africa', 'news']"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/20/ukrainian-drug-addicts-dying-due-to-treatment-ban-says-un,"Ukrainian drug addicts dying due to treatment ban, says UN",United Nations envoy says those on substitution therapy in annexed Crimea could face death after Russia made it illegal,"As many as 100 drug users in Crimea may have died since the peninsula was annexed by Russia, according to a top UN official, due to fact that the “substitution therapy” they were receiving from Ukrainian authorities being illegal under Russian law.Of 800 Crimean users who were on programmes using methadone or Buprenorphine, experts believe at least 10% have died, according to Michel Kazatchkine, the UN’s special envoy for HIV/Aids in the region. Reliable data from Russian authorities is hard to come by, but local rights activists believe the 10% figure is a conservative estimate. The deaths are “mostly overdoses or suicide” said Kazatchkine.The idea behind the programmes is to provide those addicted to heroin or other opiates with a safe way to take drugs, which does not involve injecting and thus reducing the risk of transmitting HIV and other diseases. It also decriminalises drug users, giving them the chance to begin a normal life. Legal in most countries, Ukraine has scaled up programmes using the drugs methadone and Buprenorphine, since pilot projects began in 2005.At the start of last year, there were about 8,700 Ukrainians on substitution therapy, including some 800 in Crimea, says Pavlo Skala of the HIV Alliance in Kiev. However, substitution therapy is strictly illegal in Russia, where authorities say it does not work.Instead, Russia uses “cold-turkey” detoxification programmes, and authorities moved quickly to shut down Crimea’s drug programmes within a few weeks of annexing the territory last spring.Ruslan Zhitomirsky, a 30-year-old from Simferopol in Crimea, who has been on substitution therapy for two years, said the decision to start the treatment changed his life: “I started a job in a supermarket, started talking to my family again, and even got a girlfriend. I realised how much pain I had caused my family in the years before. For the first time, I felt like I was living a normal life.”After the annexation, Zhitormirsky decided he would relocate to Kiev in order to keep taking the medication. He returned to Crimea last week for a three-day trip to see his family, and was depressed by the state of his old drug-using friends. Most of them had not wanted to move to Ukraine like him: either they did not want to leave their lives and families in Crimea, or “were scared that they would be shot by fascists in Ukraine”, having watched Russian state television. Instead, they have been slowly dying in Russian Crimea.“I know three people who went to Russian ‘detox’ centres and died, and some others who died in Simferopol,” says Ruslan. “The ones who are still alive have started injecting all kinds of filth, anything they can get their hands. I have never seen people look so ill.”After the annexation of Crimea in March last year, the territory was given a grace period until at least the end of the year, when Ukrainian laws could function alongside Russian ones. Substitution therapy could have been phased out gradually as the year went on, or it could even have been used as a pilot project to test Russia’s hardline stance on methadone and see if it could work in the Russian context.Instead, the order came that all substitution therapy programmes had to be completely halted within four weeks, even though coming off methadone safely takes several months. Doctors who prescribed the drugs after that period could go to prison for drug dealing.“This is discontinuing a treatment recommended by the World Health Organisation and UNAids; a standard international treatment that is evidence based,” says Kazatchkine. “People had to go abruptly from a state of physical, psychological and social stability in their lives to going back to the hell of street drugs, in a particularly difficult context.”The head of Russia’s drug control agency, Viktor Ivanov, has claimed that the death rate among drug users in Ukraine is twice that in Russia, and dismissed the idea of substitution therapy out of hand. Russian drugs authorities even carried out the televised burning of tens of thousands of methadone doses seized from Crimean clinics.“The death rates among people using substitution therapy were 10 times higher than the rates among those not doing so. Effectively, Ukraine was running a system to physically annihilate drug users,” Ivanov claimed during an anti-drugs meeting that took place in Crimea last July. Ivanov also said that 90% of the methadone bought by the Ukrainian state to use in the programmes found its way onto the street and was sold.“It’s bullshit,” says Skala of the HIV Alliance in Kiev. “They were saying all this even before the programmes were implemented a decade ago, and they are saying it still now. We’ve given up even trying to argue with them.”Ukrainian activists are now turning their attention to the east of the country, where patients receiving substitution therapy in areas currently controlled by pro-Russian rebels risk losing access to medication after Kiev authorities imposed a blockade on the region.Around 550 patients risk being cut off from medication. Activists are appealing to Ukrainian authorities to ensure drugs get through to avoid a repeat of the Crimean scenario.",Tue 20 Jan 2015 23.00 GMT,"['Ukraine', 'Europe', 'Russia', 'news']"

Group asked prosecutors to drop legal proceedings against two journalists,"Greenpeace said that it had given prosecutors the names of four people involved in a protest for renewable energy at the country’s famed Nazca Lines archaeological site, an action that sparked widespread outrage in Peru.In naming the activists on Tuesday, the group urged prosecutors to drop legal proceedings against two journalists who covered the 8 December event: Associated Press photographer Rodrigo Abd and Reuters video journalist Herbert Villaraga.Officials have accused participants of permanently damaging one of the country’s most important cultural treasures by using the fragile desert at the site as the backdrop for Greenpeace’s environmental message.The lines are stylized figures of animals and objects etched into landscape by a pre-Columbian culture and are a UNESCO World Heritage site. Activists walked over dark desert sands to lay yellow fabric letters near one of them that spelled out a message: “The future is renewable.” Peruvian officials say the tracks that they left marred that image, and demanded the names of those involved.

Greenpeace has apologized and offered to pay for any damage, but so far it has avoided identifying most of the 20 activists from seven countries who it says took part.Argentine-based Greenpeace official Martin Prieto said that the two people primarily responsible are German archaeologist Wolfgang Sadik and his countryman, Martin Kaiser.Their sworn declarations and those from two others involved were being delivered to prosecutors Tuesday, Greenpeace officials said.“It is the personal choice of individual participants whether they offer their names to the prosecutor. What has been given to the prosecutor includes statements offered by four participants who have given their names, addresses and a description of their role,” Greenpeace spokesman Mike Townsley said in an email.So far, prosecutors have publicly accused only three people: Argentine activist Mauro Fernandez and the two journalists.Prieto, Greenpeace regional director for Argentina, Colombia and Chile, told Associated Press that the group wants international experts to determine how best to repair whatever damage might have been done.Culture Minister Diana Alvarez-Calderon rejected that offer, saying Peruvian experts are already doing such a study.“We don’t know if we will be able to reverse the damage,” she told RPP radio.Associated Press has called for the Peruvian prosecutor to withdraw her request to jail Abd, a Peru resident who is in his home country of Argentina.Santiago Lyon, Associated Press’s vice-president and director of photography, defended the coverage of the event.“Abd is an internationally celebrated journalist who upholds the AP’s high standards of ethics and integrity,” he said. “Independent news organizations must be permitted to bear witness to news events without fear of government interference or reprisal.”The Foreign Press Association of Peru and the Institute for Press and Society of Peru have both urged authorities to exclude journalists from the criminal case.The Inter-American Press Association added its voice on Monday. “Restrictions on the movement and work of journalists are contrary to freedom of the press,” it said.",Tue 20 Jan 2015 22.36 GMT,"['Peru', 'Greenpeace', 'Protest', 'Environmental activism', 'Americas', 'news']"

They chased after three cars in which some of our guests tried to escape and wrecked them. They injured me, my brother and my father, who is almost 70 years old,” Pollac said.The attack comes amid a growing hate campaign against Israeli tourists, who are described as Israeli soldiers by antisemitic groups in Patagonia. Authorities are increasingly concerned about the appearance of posters calling for a boycott of “Israeli military tourism” in the region.The young Israeli backpackers at Onda Azul were awoken in the early hours of Monday morning by a shotgun round fired against one of the hostel cabins. Three men, ranging in age from their 20s to their 40s, wielding broken bottles and large sticks, occupied the hostel for four hours.Six policemen who arrived on the scene 45 minutes into the attack had to withdraw unable to control the situation. Three of them were hospitalised with serious blows to the head. “One had his jaw broken and lost two teeth,” Pollac said.The antisemitic campaign has attracted the attention of the government’s National Institute Against Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism (Inadi).“These anonymous deeds that try to generate a climate of persecution against Israelis or persons who profess the Jewish faith are worrying,” said Julio Accavallo, the Inadi delegate in the Patagonian city of Rio Negro.Pro-Nazi graffiti and the stamping of two-peso bills with the legend “Jews out of Patagonia” has also been reported by Inadi in the Patagonian ski resort of Bariloche, notorious for being a safe haven for Nazi fugitives after the second world war.The region also attracted international attention last year, when Jeremy Clarkson and BBC’s Top Gear crew drove through.They sparked anger because of the H982 FKL plate on Clarkson’s Porsche, which protesters claimed was a reference to the 1982 Falklands war.Clarkson and his crew finally had to flee to neighbouring Chile after their high-performance cars were stoned in Tierra del Fuego, the extreme southern end of Patagonia.Pollac closed the hostel’s doors on Monday, and fears he may never be able to reopen. “Last October they burned down one of our cabins with a Molotov cocktail. I can’t take the risk of one of our guests being killed,” he said.",Wed 21 Jan 2015 23.24 GMT,"['Argentina', 'Israel', 'Race', 'Judaism', 'Americas', 'The far right', 'Antisemitism', 'news']"

They will also free Hadi’s aide who was captured over the weekend.The deal amounts to a capitulation for the embattled leader, who will no longer have full authority to assign the entire government, or to make executive decisions without the input of the Houthis.A senior Houthi official welcomed the compromise but warned that deadlines had been breached when previous deals had been struck over the past three months. “This deal specifies a two week grace period to implement the core of what was agreed upon and we will be watching up close to see whether the government is serious or not this time,” a member of the Houthi political council told the Guardian.Rebels had earlier on Wednesday entered Hadi’s home three times, trying to force concessions that would consolidate their hold on power in Sana’a. Gulf States joined Yemeni officials in denouncing the Houthi moves as a coup and said they would do ‘whatever it takes’ defend Hadi’s leadership.The Houthis, who represent a minority Shia population in Yemen, seized a missile base on Wednesday. The rebels had effective control over much of the country’s military, which watched on earlier in the week as the rebels battled briefly with presidential guards.Houthi officials had earlier said they would rather partner with Hadi than oust him. Such a stance aims to make Hadi a client of a new Houthi-led power base, which had been flexing its muscles ever since rebels rode into Sana’a last September demanding a greater say in how the state is run.“We will not remove the president from power,” said Abdullah Shaban, a senior Houthi leader in Sana’a. “He is the president of Yemen but its our duty to ensure that he is not involved in corruption and involves all political factions in the decision making. He will remain as long as he wishes to.“I advised the president last month to take the Houthi threat seriously but his advisors led him to the hole he is in now. We will not stop putting pressure until the demands of the Yemeni people are met.”A senior UAE official in Sana’a confirmed that Gulf states were considering shutting their missions in Sana’a to protest developments.“Our government is currently studying the possibility of closing the United Arab Emirates embassy in Yemen,” the official said. “We downsized our staff months ago and we are keeping a close eye on the developments. We will close the embassy as soon as we are given orders.”On the streets of the capital, Ali Allanah, a fruit vendor located near the president’s residence said Hadi had no option but to step down. “Hadi is not the president anymore,” he said. “He can’t take care of himself let alone a country. “We only asked the president for security, thats all, and he couldn’t even grant us that.”Another local man, who fled Sana’a during clashes on Tuesday and is now scared to return said: “Its not secure for me to be in the house, but it is lawless [in Sana’a] and if militants are told my house is empty they would use it to attack government forces.”“My family is terrified and I cannot allow them to comeback to Sana’a until a deal is reached between both clashing sides. When is that going to be? I don’t know.”Authorities in Yemen’s southern port city of Aden closed all land, sea and airports on Wednesday raising fears that instability could spread to other regions of the volatile country.Oil production in Yemen’s most strategic oil province of Shabwa was halted on Saturday and fuel shortages are leading to long queues outside of petrol stations across the country.Yemen has been racked by political turmoil for much of the past four years, since an uprising, inspired by revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt and Bahrain, rumbled through the Middle East’s poorest nation.The revolt eventually led to the ousting of Ali Abdullah Saleh, who had led the country for four decades. Saleh is believed to be close to the Houthi rebels. Yemen is also battling a Sunni insurgency, with al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula remaining a potent threat in rural areas. The terror group is also active outside of the country, with the Charlie Hebdo killers boasting of carrying out the massacre in Paris earlier this month in its name.",Wed 21 Jan 2015 22.55 GMT,"['Yemen', 'Middle East and north Africa', 'news']"

Federal prosecutors plan to call them as witnesses next month at the trial, also expected to feature evidence seized during the Navy Seal raid in 2011 that left Osama bin Laden dead.At a hearing Wednesday in Brooklyn, US district judge Raymond Dearie approved the disguise request after prosecutors told him in court papers that the officers continue to work undercover on sensitive cases and “disclosure of their identities would pose a significant risk to their safety”.The agents will testify using identification numbers rather than names and wearing wigs and light makeup, “neither of which will impair the defendant’s or the jury’s ability to view the witnesses’ facial expressions and assess their credibility and demeanor”, the papers added.Naseer, 28, was extradited in 2013 to New York City where he pleaded not guilty to charges he was part of a broader al-Qaida conspiracy that included the Manchester plot and one against New York City. Two other witnesses expected to testify against Naseer – Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay – pleaded guilty in the thwarted plot to detonate homemade explosives in the subways.Prosecutors claim that email account evidence shows all three men were under the direction of the same al-Qaida handler. They also say documents recovered during the bin Laden raid – now declassified – confirm the terror network’s leadership was behind the conspiracy.Naseer has decided to serve as his own attorney at the trial.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/22/king-abdullah-of-saudi-arabia,King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia obituary,"Monarch whose reign saw the spread of division, corruption and strife, and was saved only by ‘black gold’","King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, who has died aged 90, promised much but accomplished little. By the time he came to the throne in 2005, he was 81 years old. And though he had gained considerable experience as acting monarch after his brother King Fahd’s stroke, he was beset by numerous difficulties – dynastic, democratic, religious, ideological, regional and global – and, with only rising oil revenues in his favour, found himself unable to address them to any significant extent.Abdullah’s succession as Saudi Arabia’s sixth monarch resulted from his father King Abdulaziz ibn Saud’s strategy of marrying the daughters and widows of defeated enemies. It was hoped that Abdullah’s birth in Riyadh would end the enmity between the ousted northern Hail emirate and the newly emerging Saudi kingdom. Abdullah’s mother, Fahda bint Asi al-Shuraim, was the widow of Saud ibn Rashid, who ruled over the emirate before its collapse at the hands of Saudi forces in 1921. Abdullah continued the tradition of his father and included, among his 30 or so wives, daughters of the Shaalan of Aniza, al-Fayz of Bani Sakhr, and al-Jarba of the Shammar tribe.On the basis of his mother’s background, a plethora of images were cultivated around Abdullah. Images of the monarch as the repository of the tribal bedouin heritage flourished as Saudi Arabia drifted into globalisation and a consumer culture. After a traditional upbringing in the royal court and with no formal modern instruction, the king capitalised on this heritage. His maternal connections and limited education, together with a speech impediment, delayed Abdullah’s rise to pre-eminence among the many sons of the founder of the kingdom.It was only in 1962 that he secured a permanent position in the kingdom, when he became commander of the national guard, whose task was to protect the royal house. Abdullah became second deputy prime minister in 1975 and first deputy prime minister in 1982. Crown prince under the rule of Fahd (1982-2005), Abdullah became de facto ruler in 1995, following Fahd’s prolonged illness, and king in August 2005. His main challenge was to rule amid an ageing group of powerful princes, each desperate to occupy the throne. Under Abdullah, Saudi Arabia degenerated into multiple fiefdoms with each senior prince striving to exercise authority at the expense of the others.He had inherited a kingdom torn by ideologically opposed groups, beset by unemployment, corruption, insecurity and terrorism, yet basking in a second oil boom. After a period of deceptive calm following the suppression of the 1979 siege of the Mecca mosque by the radical Islamic cell of Juhayman al-Otaibi, a violent Islamist opposition made its presence felt. Through the 1990s, Saudi Arabia paid a high price for the decision to invite foreign troops to liberate Kuwait from Saddam Hussein’s occupation. So it was that in 1995, Abdullah’s national guard in Riyadh came face to face with terrorism, when a key building used by Americans providing military training support was blown up. More attacks followed in the oil-rich eastern province in 1996. This was the beginning of a campaign that erupted into further violence after 11 September 2001.Abdullah was unable to solve other urgent domestic concerns. Restructuring the economy, joining the World Trade Organisation and privatising some sectors all failed to improve the prospects of jobless young Saudis. Women’s employment became a pressing issue. Ethnic, sectarian and regional tensions erupted with the occupation of Iraq and the increasing polarisation of Sunnis and Shias in the region. The educational system was criticised for failing to produce skilled workers and for fomenting radicalism. Maintaining Wahhabism, a type of Sunni Islam, as the state religion also became an issue, and was questioned by many Saudi citizens, as well as by the US. Abdullah established the national dialogue forum, a platform for his subjects to debate urgent concerns.Many Saudis had urged Abdullah to initiate change on social, educational, youth and economic issues when he was crown prince, and a minority considered these problems a consequence of the limited opportunities for political participation. Calls came for a radical transformation of the political system from absolute to constitutional monarchy. Reformers demanded that Abdullah should establish an elected consultative assembly to replace the 120-member appointed Shura council. Many observers viewed a wave of human rights petitions in 2003-05 as the new Riyadh spring that would lead to Saudi Arabia becoming a state of institutions rather than of princes.But the reformers’ hopes were shattered when, in 2004, the minister of the interior, Prince Nayef, arrested many signatories. When Abdullah became king a few months later, he released the detainees and made promises to curb corruption and increase consultation. However, he failed to stop the tide of oppression that his brother had spread on the pretext of the war on terror. The passports of many peaceful activists were confiscated. Corruption went unchecked and the king remained silent over the Al-Yamamah arms deal, exposed in 2003 by the Guardian as a scandal implicating the British military contractor BAE Systems and Prince Sultan, Saudi minister of defence and also the crown prince.To deal with internal power struggles within the royal circle, in 2006 Abdullah announced the establishment of the allegiance committee, a secretive body consisting of the most senior princes in charge of appointing the future king – but only after Abdullah himself and Crown Prince Sultan had served as kings. This committee was meant to guarantee smooth succession to the throne and to regulate the transfer of power within the Saudi house from one generation to another.Unable to bring about political reforms at home, Abdullah staked his reputation on influencing regional politics. However, his Arab peace initiative, announced initially in an interview with the New York Times journalist Thomas Friedman, and reannounced during the Arab League summit in Beirut in 2002, failed. Abdullah had proposed peace in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 borders, pressed for the right of return for Palestinian refugees, and called for a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. Israel did not accept.The initiative’s revival in March 2007 did not bring tangible results. Drawing on Mecca’s symbolic significance in the imagination of Muslims, Abdullah held meetings there to reconcile the warring Palestinian factions, but without lasting success. In April 2003 the American occupation of Iraq removed a regional competitor. Abdullah, together with other Gulf rulers, breathed a sigh of relief over the demise of Saddam’s regime. But it was short-lived. Nobody expected that the promised model democracy in Iraq would pose any threat to other dictators in the region. However, containing the Iraqi sectarian war and combating al-Qaida in Iraq became urgent issues for Abdullah.Even more so was Iran. With its nuclear programme, it emerged as the new regional power, influencing not only the outcome of the Iraq war but also interfering in the fabric of Arab society and politics through its patronage of Shia communities and Sunni political groups, notably Hamas. With a substantial Shia minority in the Saudi eastern province, Abdullah became nervous about the emerging Shia power.Together with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Abdullah of Jordan, the Saudi monarch expressed alarm over the so-called emerging Shia crescent. Protecting the interests of Iraqi Sunni co-religionists was problematic given the complexity of the Iraqi scene and the presence of al-Qaida, which also presented itself as a defender of the Sunnis. Abdullah denounced sectarian killings and insisted on the unity of the Iraqi state. Mecca proved to be the right place for a meeting under Saudi patronage and warring Iraqi Sunni and Shia leaders and religious scholars pledged to end Muslim bloodshed. However, neither this meeting nor increased US military presence stopped suicide bombers targeting civilians in Iraqi cities.Iran’s growing influence needed a counter-force to balance it. The west looked to Saudi Arabia but failed to see how poor Abdullah’s credentials were, even among Sunni Muslims in the region. Although he was sitting on vast oil revenues, neither the wisdom of old age, traditional authority nor charisma gave him special rank among Arab rulers.The Israeli-Hezbollah 33-day war in the summer of 2006 and the Saudi failure to push for an immediate ceasefire further eroded the king’s credibility. As the Israeli press ran articles praising Abdullah, and the Saudi-owned media referred to Hezbollah’s war with Israel as an adventure, thus echoing official Saudi statements, the king’s reputation at home and in the Arab world was questioned. During that summer, Abdullah fell out with Bashar al-Assad of Syria, who referred to defeated Arab rulers as “half men”, and there were also angry responses in Egypt and Jordan. After that war, the polarisation between the so-called moderates under the leadership of Saudi Arabia, and the radicals under Iran’s patronage, became acute. It was beyond Abdullah’s ability to reconcile the two camps.In addition to the rift with Syria over Lebanon (and previously with Libya over an alleged attempt to assassinate him), Abdullah could not overcome the animosity of other partners in the Gulf co-operation council. Worsening relations with Qatar over the blunt approach of the Qatari TV channel al-Jazeera and territorial disputes created an uneasy situation. Older Egyptian-Saudi rivalries occasionally surfaced, with both desperate to get credit for cooling Arab troublespots.Abdullah tried hard to mend fences with the US after 9/11, as Saudi citizens were implicated in the attack on the twin towers. In a meeting with President George Bush in Crawford, Texas, in 2005, he promised religious and educational reforms, and to increase oil production to stabilise prices. He also continued to allow the US to use Saudi bases to launch the war on Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003.Later, at the London conference on the future of Afghanistan in 2010, it was agreed that peace overtures would be made to senior Taliban members, with Abdullah’s help.Both Abdullah and the Americans knew that they were locked in an eternal marriage. After 9/11, the question was how to continue the relationship without antagonising the in-laws on both sides. The US administration occasionally espoused the rhetoric of democratisation to silence an American constituency increasingly critical of the kingdom’s radical interpretation of Islam and its record on human rights.On the Saudi side, the departure of US troops stationed in the country to neighbouring Qatar was meant to debunk jihadi pledges to “remove infidels from the Arabian peninsula”. Neither measures led to silencing critical voices or bombs. Terrorist attacks not only continued in Saudi Arabia, but increased in frequency and magnitude, while many Americans continued to ask whether Saudi Arabia was friend or foe.Britain never questioned Abdullah’s domestic policy, his political reforms or lack of them. When he was prime minister, Tony Blair went even further, calling for a halt to the Serious Fraud Office investigation into al-Yamamah arms deal in 2007. British “national interests” required the covering up one of the most scandalous episodes in the history of arms dealing.Britain welcomed Abdullah during a state visit in October 2007. The royal pomp was mildly disturbed as demonstrators, human rights activists and the families of Britons tortured in Saudi prisons objected to the visit. A last-minute minor diplomatic incident spoiled the atmosphere of co-operation and friendship. Before his arrival, Abdullah declared to the BBC journalist John Simpson that Britain was not doing enough to fight terrorism. Saudi Arabia provided intelligence information before the 7/7 London bombing, Abdullah said, but London failed to act, according to the monarch.During the last years of his reign, Abdullah ruled over a country with incredible economic resources that failed to guarantee him regional influence. Saudi foreign policy was in fact mostly reactive to events beyond its control. Like many expired authoritarian rulers, he promoted himself as the champion of women’s rights in a desperate attempt to appeal to sceptical audiences at home and abroad. His development projects, new universities and industrial cities generated more controversy than solutions to real economic problems. However, Abdullah was perhaps the first Saudi ruler to seek a new legitimacy, this time emanating from serving the people rather than simply applying divine law.Like other Arab leaders, Abdullah was surprised by the Arab uprisings of 2011 and feared the power of peaceful protest reaching the quiet kingdom. Within months, the Shias of the eastern province copied the methods of protesters abroad and began to demonstrate in their own neighbourhoods. Under Abdullah, hundreds of Saudi reformers, activists and human rights defenders were rounded up and put in prison, where they are serving long sentences. The reformer king failed to initiate a single item of a political reform agenda.In January 2011, Abdullah had offered refuge to the deposed Tunisian president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, and together with other Gulf leaders he worked on reversing the democratic tide in Egypt. The oil surplus was deployed to fix Saudi Arabia as a counter-revolutionary force, aiming to overthrow the elected Muslim Brotherhood government and return Egypt to the rule of a single president, loyal to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf patrons. Fear of the domino effect of the uprisings prompted Abdullah to seek Gulf unity, but resistance from Qatar and Oman put the unification project on hold.Abdullah pushed for the US to increase its involvement in the Syrian uprising, which he saw as a proxy war to defeat Iran, which had supported the Assad regime, and roll back its influence. He felt abandoned by the US as it sought negotiations with Iran over its nuclear weapon programme.After years of seeking a non-permanent seat at the UN security council, Abdullah refused to take it when it was made available in October 2013, thus reflecting his frustration with US policies – notably Barack Obama’s slow reaction to the crisis in the region, his rapprochement with Iran, his failure to support allies such as the deposed Egyptian president and the stalemate on the Palestinian-Israeli peace process. In June 2014 Abdullah joined the anti-Islamic State international coalition to ward off increasing suspicion of Saudi sponsorship of radical jihadi groups in Syria.Months before his death, Abdullah may have been alarmed by sensational stories about his daughters allegedly imprisoned in the palace. His divorced wife and the mother of the daughters, al-Anoud al-Fayez, brought the story to the attention of British media after several years of silence.It may be good to be king in a region where the Arab masses rejected their presidents. However, Abdullah will be remembered as someone who survived the wave of change, propped up by “black gold”, in his own kingdom by distributing largesse and repression and helped to reverse the prospect of democracy in the Arab world.He is believed to have had around 30 wives, 15 sons and 20 daughters.

The Americans say the resumption in full diplomatic relations depends on how quickly its requests are met. Cuba is demanding its removal from a US list of state sponsors of terrorism, which Washington says it is considering.On Wednesday, the US said it dispatched additional ships to the Florida Straits to halt Cuban rafters but rebuffed demands for broader changes to US migration rules that grant virtually automatic legal residency to any Cuban who touches US soil.Russian intelligence ship docks in Havana day before US-Cuba talksRead moreCuba’s government blames the cold war policy for luring tens of thousands of Cubans a year to make perilous journeys by land and sea to try to reach the United States. Still, many Cubans are worried the elimination of the rules would take away their chance to have a better life in the US.In Washington, US Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson said America’s “wet foot, dry foot” approach, which generally shields Cubans from deportation if they reach US territory, remains in effect. But he stressed that those trying to come illegally would most likely be interdicted and returned.US officials reported a spike in the number of rafters attempting to reach Florida after the 17 December announcement that the countries would move to normalize ties. Those numbers appear to have slowed in recent days.“Cuba wants a normal relationship with the US, in the broadest sense but also in the area of migration,” said Cuba’s head of North American affairs, Josefina Vidal. She called for the US to end “exceptional treatment that no other citizens in the world receive, causing an irregular situation in the flow of migrants”.American officials instead pressed Cuba to take back tens of thousands of its nationals whom US authorities want to deport because they have been convicted of crimes. No progress was made on that issue, according to an official present in the meeting. The official wasn’t authorized to speak on the matter and demanded anonymity.The talks Thursday are expected to focus on the broader question of how the US and Cuba can end a half-century of enmity – as promised by Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro last month. The nations hope to re-establish embassies and post ambassadors to each other’s capitals in the coming months.After meeting with the Cubans for more than three hours, the State Department’s Alex Lee said the “discussions prove that despite clear differences that remain between our countries, the United States and Cuba can find opportunities to advance our mutual, shared interests as well as engage in respectful and thoughtful dialogue.”Lee led the US delegation ahead of Wednesday afternoon’s arrival of Roberta Jacobson, the top American diplomat for Latin America and most senior US official to visit Cuba since 1980.Somma, spokesman for the Coast Guard’s 7th district in Miami, said “aggressively” stepped-up patrols have eased the increase in rafters seen immediately after the twin announcements last month by Castro and Obama.“We have seen a slowdown in the last two weeks,” he said.",Thu 22 Jan 2015 21.58 GMT,"['Cuba', 'US foreign policy', 'Americas', 'news']"

He said, ‘Why are you sad? Forget about your home and family. This is your home and we are your family now.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/24/png-women-accused-of-sorcery-saved-from-murder-in-remote-village,PNG women accused of sorcery saved from murder in remote village,Intervention by police and missionaries hailed as a victory after saving four women accused of using witchcraft to bring on deadly measles outbreak,"A recent intervention preventing the murder of four women accused of sorcery is being hailed as a victory in the push to eradicate witchcraft-related attacks in Papua New Guinea, but those fighting the battle say the violence is still increasing.After a measles outbreak killed several people in Enga province last year, four women were accused of bringing it upon the remote community with witchcraft, leaving them and their families in danger of being killed. Last week the ABC reported police and missionaries led an intervention to save the women, and claim they successfully talked local people around.The Enga deputy police commander, Epenes Nili, told Guardian Australia he and a delegation flew into the village where the women had been confined.“There we met four women who called themselves [fortune tellers] – they were already there to receive us,” said Nili. “We sat all of the [villagers] down and we told them what the fortune tellers said was all lies, and to squeeze money.”Nili said they explained the laws and new punishments associated with the violence they had planned and church leaders spoke about Christianity.“In their own custom when they turn over a stone it means they will not say these things again or not do these things again. In front of us they turned a huge stone and stood on top of it.”He said members of the community who would normally take up the role of executioner broke their weapons in front of the delegation as a symbolic and practical gesture.Violence against women is routinely described as an “epidemic” in PNG, and summary acts of retribution for perceived acts of witchcraft play a significant role. Belief in the supernatural powers of witches and sorcerers is entrenched in parts of the diverse and largely tribal country. A law which provided a defence to violence if it was done to “stop witchcraft” was only repealed in 2013.Amnesty International described the move as one step forward and several steps back, as on the same day the government also expanded the death penalty to a wider range of crimes – including the murder of an accused sorcerer – indicating they may resume executions.Associate professor Richard Eves, from the state society and governance in Melanesia program at ANU, described the repeal as a “kneejerk response” and said the issue of sorcery violence has been largely ignored. While the government has made some efforts, the work to combat gender-based violence is often left to church groups and NGOs.Improvements in the health system, education and a better law and order response are all needed, Eves told Guardian Australia.Enga deputy police commander Epenes Nili speaks to villagers of Wanakipa in Papua New Guinea. Photograph: Anton Lutz/ABC“My response [to the Enga intervention] is it’s a good thing that it’s happened but when you look at the police response to the very important case in 2013 of a woman who was burned in Mount Hagen – nobody has been prosecuted over that yet.”20-year-old Kepari Leniata was stripped, doused in petrol and burned alive after she was accused of sorcery over the death of a young boy from illness. Two people were charged but there has been no conviction.“Many police subscribe to the views that sorcerers and witches get their just desserts,” Eves said. “You need to have really good human rights training with the police and really have to start trying to get at some of the cultural underlying belief in sorcery and witchcraft. The Catholic church in Chimbu province has quite a good response – when somebody dies they are quickly on the scene, and start talking about alternatives.”Father Philip Gibbs is based in Mount Hagen in PNG’s Western Highlands province, which shares a border with Chimbu. He has taken a “particular interest” in working to combat sorcery-related violence, both in rescuing people and raising awareness among communities.Often when he arrives at a town or village after hearing a person is has been accused of sorcery, he faces strong resistance.A group of the “accused” at the village of Wanakipa who made a public statement that they are “saying no” to that identity and label. The woman in the middle revealed that she had been pressured and bribed to name the others. She then retracted the accusations and returned the bribes. Photograph: Anton Lutz/ABC“I went to one place recently and … I wanted to speak to a woman who’d been tortured and they said no. There had been all sorts of intertribal tensions and they thought my presence would exacerbate those tensions. Where my coming might make that worse I have to really decide what’s best to do. If someone’s going to die out of it you have to intervene, but sometimes you can’t.”There has been some “patchy” progress made in combatting sorcery-related violence, Gibbs believes, but it predates government efforts. Anecdotally, there seem to be fewer accusations in neighbouring Chimbu province after the Catholic church initiated a plan, he said.“On the other hand I’ve seen a growth into areas where it wasn’t there before. I think there is a net increase at the moment.”Others have also noticed an increase in sorcery accusations.Gibbs puts the spread of the beliefs down to increasing rates of intermarriage and travel between regions.“In Enga province, for example, there was no history of witchcraft,” he said, likening its arrival to a bushfire or a virus. “There’s no resistance.”Gibbs runs workshops to educate people on the laws and problems associated with sorcery accusations.“I help people become aware of things such as if there is talk of someone being a witch, was that person being tortured? From what I’ve seen in all cases when people admit it they are under incredible pressure – tyres being lined up next to them, the smell of petrol, heated knives. That needs to be pointed out to [people].”Joshua, translator for police commander Epenes Nili. Photograph: Anton Lutz/ABCAs a priest, Gibbs’s work is obviously heavily based on Christian teachings, which also played a part in Enga as villagers were given Bibles and warned of the sins they planned to commit.Both Christianity and local beliefs share aspects of spirituality, he said. “Christians talk about Satan and devils and so on, but I think I’d emphasise that Christian faith is there to help people have life and have a better life and to heal people.”In other parts of the country some bishops have even gone so far as to threaten excommunication, the ABC reported this week.For now, deputy commander Nili is confident the four women and their children in Enga are safe, and believes the region is at the beginning of a turning point.“We are trying to get police officers to go into the jungle areas and to get the message [out] about sorcery belief.

Nisman had been due to testify to Congress on his allegations that President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner had conspired to protect Iranian officials implicated in the attack on the Argentinian Jewish Mutual Association, Amia, in which 85 people died.On Friday, the Amia, the Daia – the country’s affiliate to the World Jewish Congress – the Holocaust Museum of Buenos Aires and other groups announced their refusal to send any representatives to the ceremony at the country’s foreign ministry on Tuesday.“The charges are so gruesome and extend to so many areas of government that it would be an insult to the memory of our victims of the Shoah to attend,” said Waldo Wolff, vicepresident of the DAIA, the son of a Jewish survivor of Nazi Germany who soughtrefuge in Argentina after Germany’s Kristallnacht anti-Jewish pogroms of1938.Anger was focused on the alleged role of the foreign minister, Héctor Timerman, who Nisman alleged had participated in secret talks with Iran – and who is also Jewish.“I am horrified by the charge that someone who is both an Argentinian and a Jew is suspected of plotting to cast darkness on an investigation undertaken in his own country to solve the Amia bombing,” said Diana Wang, head of the Children of the Shoah association. Wang arrived in Argentina in 1947 at barely two years of age with her parents, who were Holocaust survivors.Argentinian government points to rogue intelligence agents in Nisman deathRead moreAs prosecutor in the Amia investigation, Nisman had attempted to obtain Interpol arrest warrants for the five Iranian officials to stand trial in Argentina. In the charges he presented in court only four days before his death, Nisman claimed that Fernández and Timerman plotted to lift those warrants in exchange for Iranian oil.Government officials have rejected the allegations, and suggested that Nisman was killed by rogue intelligence agents.The decision not to attend the celebration of the 70th anniversary of theliberation of Auschwitz concentration camp is a sharp blow to Argentina’sgovernment, which has dedicated many years of patient effort to clear thiscountry’s reputation as a post-war safe haven for some of the most importantNazi criminals, such as Adolf Eichmann, who organised the transport ofmillions of Jews to the concentration camps, and the Auschwitz doctor JosefMengele.",Fri 23 Jan 2015 21.19 GMT,"['Argentina', 'Americas', 'Holocaust', 'news']"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/23/unrest-jeopardises-yemens-key-role-us-counterrorism,Regime collapse threatens Yemen's key role in US counter-terrorism strategy,The rise of Shia Houthi rebels and the fall of the Hadi government have shaken country whose ‘deep state’ has long been a bedrock of US fight against terror,"For almost 15 years, the US’s relationship with Yemen has been defined by an intelligence relationship that eclipsed all other nation-building measures and anchored America’s global counter-terrorism strategy.Now, though, with two Washington-backed presidents having fallen in less than four years and the established military jeopardised by chaos, policymakers are bereft of solutions.Shia Houthi rebels seized decisive control of the country’s north this week, following months of civil war and years of lawlessness and corruption.On Tuesday, the rebels routed government forces and overran the presidential palace in the capital, Sana’a. Weakened by poverty and the waning support of neighboring Saudi Arabia, government institutions fell in a matter of days and Sunni extremists rallied in the southern provinces. The besieged president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, finally acceded to the demands of the Houthis on Thursday.Hadi’s resignation and the collapse of the government has left Yemen-US relations at a more unstable juncture than at any point since the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000, a seminal event in the two countries’ fraught history. Ever since, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (Aqap) has slowly evolved into a potent threat on a regional stage – with a demonstrated will to make its presence felt elsewhere.“When you have this laser-like focus on a limited [counter-terrorism] mission that sort of distorts your perspective,” said Micah Zenko, a national security scholar at the Council of Foreign Relations.During Hadi’s presidency and, before that, during Ali Abdullah Saleh’s, the US has launched 107 drone strikes in south Yemen, where Aqap has rallied and planned attacksThe north had been left largely to a frail political class, which proved susceptible to the rise of the Houthis. “Under US policy guidance the leader of Yemen means nothing as to whether the US can conduct military strikes in the south,” said Zenko, adding that the main effect of the Houthi rebellion on US policy will likely take place at intelligence levels that are opaque to outside observers.Zenko noted that the US has not carried out a drone strike in Yemen since November, probably as “human intelligence diminished because the Yemeni security forces became preoccupied with other missions”. He said that American missions against Aqap will depend “on the degree to which US intelligence is in normal, day-to-day working contact” with Yemeni security forces.With all strategic military bases in Sana’a now at least partially controlled by the Houthis, the implications for military operations remain unclear. Asked what the collapse of the Yemeni government would mean for US policy toward the country, a State Department spokesperson said the Houthis and the US had a common enemy in Aqap but added that developments were still being analysed.On Friday, the US sharply scaled back its presence in Sana’a, pulling more staff out of its embassy.Policymakers in the US and Britain fear the creation of a vacuum in Yemen similar to those in which jihadists have thrived in Syria and Iraq.“Aqap were on the back foot and facing existential dilemmas, but the rise of the Houthis has handed them a golden opportunity,” said a western official in the region. “They have been presenting themselves as the only ones who can stop the ‘Shia’ Houthis. They are seeking to make a struggle that is essentially about power, money and territory a sectarian struggle.”“Aqap are up there on the list of worries that keep people in our capitals up at night. They invented the non-metallic IED and, through Inspire magazine, Aqap is the powerhouse of the relatively lone gunman.”Both the White House and the State Department said cooperation on counter-terrorism continues despite Yemen’s present disarray. Obama administration spokesman Josh Earnest said the US had made “investments” in Yemen’s government. “We continue a strong counter-terrorism partnership with the national security infrastructure of Yemen,” he said, “and we continue to be very vigilant to counter Aqap.”State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said the US was in contact with “a range of officials” and still considers Hadi the nation’s current president. But she articulated a policy of wait-and-see with regard to Yemen’s future, calling the Houthis “a legitimate political constituency” and saying “it’s up to the Yemeni people to determine what their future is.”“We’re not naive,” Psaki said, but she stressed that the US’s current emphasis was that Yemen’s politics play out in peaceful transition. She said the US would watch whether the Houthis abide by recent assurances that they do not pose a threat to American interests.Experts say the relationship that matters most to the US is with Yemen’s “deep state” – the security and intelligence forces that wield outsize power and influence in many repressive countries. The US budgeted $45m in non-military aid to Yemen in 2014 but has separately supported the country’s security forces for years. Whether those forces continue to cooperate, are subsumed by Houthi rebels, or are pulled too deeply into the civil war will determine much of whether the US can maintain a presence in Yemen.A parliamentary session on Friday did nothing to restore any semblance of stability after the government collapsed on Thursday night. One day earlier, state media reported Hadi had agreed to power-sharing demands made by the Houthis after they shelled his palace and house, kidnapped his chief aide and overran essential state institutions.The apparent concession was redundant within hours though, when Hadi, the prime minister and his cabinet resigned en masse, blindsiding the Houthis, who thought they had secured political control.Sana’a was eerily quiet on Friday, locals reported, with tension palpable in all public places and in cafes that would normally be bustling on the first day of the weekend.Political and military leaders were refusing to take calls, and all embassies remained closed.The US relationship with Yemen’s presidents has been so critical that it has been handled personally by President Barack Obama’s chief counter-terrorism aides: the White House’s Lisa Monaco and her predecessor, John Brennan, now the CIA director.Much of the US-Yemeni military relationship, which the Obama administration has prioritised in order to fight Aqap, runs between the two countries’ special-operations forces. US commandos have nurtured their Yemeni counterparts, who have received many millions’ worth of helicopters, night-vision goggles, transport aircraft and surveillance equipment.",Fri 23 Jan 2015 21.00 GMT,"['Yemen', 'Al-Qaida', 'Middle East and north Africa', 'US foreign policy', 'Obama administration', 'analysis']"

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/24/japan-attempts-verify-isis-hostage-beheading-video-yukawa,Shinzo Abe: claims of Haruna Yukawa's murder by Isis appear genuine,Man claiming to be captive journalist Kenji Goto announces killing of Japanese hostage Haruna Yukawa,"Japan’s prime minister Shinzo Abe said that the chilling recording claiming that Haruna Yukawa, one of two Japanese men taken hostage by Islamic State, had been beheaded appeared to be genuine.Barack Obama issued a statement condemning what he called “the brutal murder” and that the United States would stand “shoulder to shoulder” with Japan. The US president called for the immediate release of the second Japanese hostage, 47-year-old journalist Kenji Goto.In the brief tape a man claiming to be Goto says his “cellmate” is dead and pleads for his own life. Speaking in English with a Japanese accent, he says Isis has dropped its demand for a $100m ransom and instead wants to organise a prisoner exchange for a woman held in Jordan. The still image released with the tape shows Goto apparently holding a picture of Yukawa’s body.The Japanese government had said on Saturday it was investigating the recording, which appeared quite different in format from the string of videos Isis produced to show the murders of other foreign hostages.But Abe later said it was genuine, adding that he was left “speechless” by the killing.Abe said that the release of the new message was “an outrageous and unforgivable act and called for the “immediate release” of Goto.Speaking on NHK TV, Abe declined to comment on the possibility of a prisoner exchange for Goto, noting that the government was still working on the situation. He declined to elaborate, and reiterated that Japan strongly condemns terrorist acts.Yukawa’s father, Shoichi, also faced Japanese media on Sunday and said he hoped “deep in his heart” that the news of his son’s killing was not true.“If I am ever reunited with him, I just want to give him a big hug,” he said.The prisoner whom Isis wants released is Sajida al-Rishawi, an Iraqi woman who was sent on an al-Qaida bombing mission to Jordan in 2005 with her husband. They targeted a wedding in a hotel, and he killed at least 57 people, but she was caught after her suicide belt failed to detonate.Japan’s deputy foreign minister, Yasuhide Nakayama, is in Jordan to try to coordinate rescue efforts. He was sent soon after the first video of the hostages surfaced, but in the hours before an arbitrary deadline for the ransom payment, Japanese officials admitted they had not been able to reach Isis representatives to start a dialogue.Yukawa, 42, from Chiba prefecture near Tokyo, went to Syria last year after a series of personal misfortunes. Goto is a respected author and freelance journalist who ran a small media company, and went to cover the Syrian conflict.On Tuesday the two men appeared together in a video released by Isis’s al-Furqan media outlet entitled “A message to the government at the people of Japan” that set a 72-hour deadline for the Japanese government to pay a $200m ransom, $100m for each hostage. It had a format similar to previous hostage videos, with the men in orange jumpsuits kneeling on a hillside in a rocky desert, while a British-sounding militant standing between them issued demands.Yukawa was originally detained in April in northern Syria by anti-government militant group the Free Syrian Army, and Goto, who was in the area, was brought as an interpreter for the group to interrogate him. He was captured again some time after 21 July, when his blog entries stopped. In August, Isis released a YouTube video showing him with a bleeding face and lying on the ground, identifying himself as Japanese and not a spy.In early October Goto is understood to have travelled between Japan and Syria, arriving there again some time around 22 October. There has been speculation that he may have travelled to come to the aid of Yukawa.This is not the first time Japan has faced a hostage crises from Islamic militants. In 2004, followers of Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in Iraq beheaded a 24-year-old backpacker Shosei Koda. A video by Zarqawi’s group, which later became the Islamic State group, showed Koda begging Japan’s then-prime minister to save him.At the time prime minister Junichiro Koizumi told reporters: “I cannot allow terrorism and cannot bow to terrorism.” Koda’s body was found a few days later dumped in Baghdad.David Cameron said the reported killing was “another reminder of the murderous barbarity of these terrorists.” The British prime minister said the UK “stands in solidarity with the Japanese people” and backed the “firm stance” taken by his counterpart in Tokyo.Barack Obama said in a statement that was issued while he was en route to India: “Our condolences today are with the people of Japan for their terrible loss.”“We renew our call for the immediate release of Kenji Goto and all other remaining hostages.”",Sat 24 Jan 2015 23.24 GMT,"['Japan', 'Asia Pacific', 'Islamic State', 'Syria', 'Middle East and north Africa', 'news']"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/24/argentina-prosecutor-death-mystery,Ex-wife of shot Argentinian prosecutor seeks new postmortem and bullet tests,Intervention by judge adds to the murder drama that is darkening president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner’s last term in office,"The investigation into the apparent murder of Argentina’s emblematic prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, took a dramatic turn on Saturday after his former wife, Judge Sandra Arroyo Salgado, emerged as a powerful new player in a cloak-and-dagger drama that has had Argentina on tenterhooks since Nisman’s body was found, a handgun underneath it, in his Buenos Aires apartment.“He didn’t commit suicide,” Arroyo Salgado told court investigators in eight hours of testimony. Divorced from Nisman for three years, Arroyo Salgado has handled major cases at her courtroom in the San Isidro suburb of Buenos Aires. Like her former husband, she is reputed to have extensive connections with police investigators and secret intelligence operatives.Her emergence could open up new leads; she is expected to demand a new postmortem examination and ballistic tests in the name of the two teenage daughters she had with Nisman.Arroyo Salgado’s conviction that her former husband was murdered and her demand for new forensic tests could see her in open battle with the investigative prosecutor in the case, Viviana Fein, who on Saturday announced the official test results: “The shot was fired at a distance of no more than one centimetre, with the gun placed against the temple,” Fein told television journalists. She said time of death was around noon on Sunday and there was “no evidence of the participation of other persons”.“I can’t think about anything else,” said a waitress at a corner café in the trendy Palermo Hollywood district, where patrons pored over magazines and newspapers, all with pictures of Nisman on their covers. Nisman’s death, 24 hours before he was to present explosive evidence against Argentina’s beleaguered president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, at an emergency congressional hearing, has elevated the prosecutor to the status of political martyr. He is increasingly being seen as a victim of a virulent palace intrigue unfolding in the final months of the stormy rule of Argentina’s president.With enough twists and turns to satisfy the most avid conspiracy theorist, the case throws up probable culprits ranging from the alleged Iranian terrorists whom he sought to bring to trial for the deaths of 85 victims at a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires 20 years ago, to either Fernández acolytes avenging his charges against the president or wrathful palace intriguers exacting revenge on the president by killing the man who dared to challenge her.Fernández fingered spy chief “Jaime” Stiuso (whose real name is apparently Antonio Horacio Stiuso) as her main suspect. The 61-year-old intelligence operative has become a household name after Fernández alleged that Stiuso provided Nisman with hundreds of hours of intercepted calls on which the prosecutor built his case, accusing the president of attempting through secret negotiations to derail Nisman’s attempts to extradite five Iranian officials to stand trial for the Amia Jewish community centre blast in 1994.In return for immunity, Fernández asked Iran for oil to plug the widening energy gap that is endangering Argentina’s economy, Nisman alleged. Fernández has strongly denied the charge. “Everything is false,” the president said about Nisman’s charges.Stiuso has never been seen in public and has been interviewed only once in his life, last month a few days before Fernández fired him from his top post at the intelligence secretariat.“Stiuso was obsessed with the Amia case,” says Rodis Recalt, the journalist from Noticias magazine who interviewed him. “He worked closely with Nisman to build the case against Iran.”Accustomed to living under constant threat, Nisman changed his Whatsapp profile picture for a photo of himself captioned “Keep Calm And We Don’t Negotiate With Terrorism”. At about the same time he asked one of his assistants for a gun, saying that he feared for his life. The following evening he was found dead on his bathroom floor.An adoring father of two teenage girls, Nisman lived alone in a small apartment on the 13th floor of one of the three 42-storey towers of Le Parc complex in the expensive Puerto Madero district. Although his bodyguards noticed he wasn’t answering calls , it wasn’t until 10pm that his 73-year-old mother, Sara Garfunkel, entered the apartment with the help of a locksmith. The media picked up on the story after a neighbour started posting pictures on his Twitter account of police arriving in large numbers at the entrance to Nisman’s building.Nerves are increasingly frayed in Buenos Aires for anyone involved in the Nisman case. Damian Pachter of the Buenos Aires Herald, the first journalist to announce the news of the prosecutor’s death – on his Twitter account a few minutes after midnight on Sunday – left Argentina hurriedly this morning.“I’m leaving because my life is in danger,” Pachter told the newspaper Clarín. He believes he will not be able to return until a change of government in December. “I ran like hell,” he said, leaving his car in the newspaper’s car park. The Fopea association of journalists called on the authorities for “maximum attention for the security of journalists”.With presidential elections scheduled for October – in which she cannot compete, having already served two terms in office – Fernández is skidding badly in her final months, beset by inflation, devaluation, corruption charges, power cuts, a foreign debt default, and now the mysterious death of a prosecutor who accused her of conspiring with Iran.Her dwindling cast of supporters point to Stiuso as Nisman’s likely killer, in revenge for being ousted by his former master. Her opponents say it is the other way around: that Fernández fired him in an attempt to stop Nisman from presenting the charges that are now exploding on a long fuse after his death.“Stiuso left Argentina, just in case,” says Recalt. The larger question remains who blew up the Amia 20 years ago, still one of the most politically charged open wounds in Argentinian society.“It doesn’t matter if I know who blew up the Amia,” Stiuso told Recalt before being dismissed by Fernández. “All that matters is what I can prove.”",Sat 24 Jan 2015 22.59 GMT,"['Argentina', 'The Observer', 'news']"

Thanks everybody. We’ll talk soon,” Damian Pachter tweeted.A citizen of Argentina and Israel, he worked for the English-language Buenos Aires Herald. Pachter fled Argentina after receiving threats, and being followed, he told colleagues in other media.The reporter, who also worked with Israel’s Haaretz, told colleagues his phones had been tapped in Argentina.“I will return when my sources tell me that the conditions have changed,” Pachter told the Herald. “I don’t think that will happen under this administration.”The prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, was found dead with a bullet to the head in his Buenos Aires home a week ago, just before he was set to go before a congressional hearing to accuse Kirchner and foreign minister Hector Timerman of shielding Iranian officials implicated in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish charities federation office that killed 85 people.It was the worst terror attack in modern history for Argentina, home to Latin America’s largest Jewish community.Several pretrials in the case were cancelled amid serious irregularities involving judges and Argentine intelligence staff, so it has not yet been fully prosecuted.Kirchner’s government meanwhile has come under fire for publishing on the presidential office Twitter details of the Aerolineas Argentinas plane ticket Pachter purchased.The Herald said it could not confirm threats against Pachter but that he had not returned to work.Kirchner, meanwhile, has said she believes the 51-year-old was murdered in a plot to implicate her government in a coverup.Viviana Fein, the prosecutor leading the investigation, said she was waiting for ballistics analysis, including a DNA comparison, and to see whether the bullet taken from the body matches the .22-caliber weapon found at the scene.Before his death, Nisman had filed a 280-page complaint charging that Kirchner had issued an “express directive” to shield a group of Iranian suspects in the 1994 bombing.Nisman contended that the government had agreed to swap grain for oil with Tehran in exchange for withdrawing “red notices” to Interpol seeking the arrests of the former and current Iranian officials accused in the unsolved case.Since 2006, Argentine courts have demanded the extradition of eight Iranians, including former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, former defence minister Ahmad Vahidi and Iran’s former cultural attache in Buenos Aires, Mohsen Rabbani, for the bombing.But in 2013, Kirchner signed a memorandum of understanding with Tehran agreeing to set up a “truth commission” to investigate the bombing and allowing Argentine prosecutors to question the suspects in Iran.The rapprochement was vehemently opposed at the time by Jewish community leaders, who charged it was “unconstitutional.”",Sun 25 Jan 2015 23.40 GMT,"['Argentina', 'Cristina Fernández de Kirchner', 'Americas', 'news']"

When it erupted, at approximately 7.15pm, it exploded with a bang.“The hour of the left has come. The hour of the left has come. Hope has finally arrived.”They were all there. The middle class in coats frayed by overuse. The old in bobble hats. The young, clapping and punching the air, gay people flying the rainbow flag, immigrants wide-eyed and expectant, foreigners who had flown in to savour victory at its best.“It’s fantastic, absolutely fantastic,” enthused Florent Gomez, a French museum employee in Athens especially for “the event.”“Syriza’s win is our win,” the 32-year-old shouted over the din. “We are all here to hear Alexis Tsipras. He is a great politician, the best example for Europe. Now Spain, Italy and France must follow.”It didn’t take long for the jubilant to arrive. At the head of the crowd, amid a flurry of flag-waving Marxists, came a group of Italians, holding a giant ruby red banner emblazoned with the words L’Altra Europa con Tsipras.By 9pm on Sunday, when the radical party’s ascent to power had been wholeheartedly confirmed, so many had poured into Klafthmonos Square – the crowd working its way up and then spilling out from under the ornate neoclassical premises of Athens’ university building – it was impossible to keep count.“Happiness is a wonderful thing,” said Efi Athinaiou, her eyes misting a little. “Especially when there has been so much misery and it comes on a wave of hope.”Tonight, she said, belonged to everyone on the left but mostly it belonged to the Greeks – ordinary people who had been so whipped by austerity and now had dared to take the leap into the unknown.“Our party has never been tested by power. We will prove that we can do it. We will show that there is another way.”It is hard to overestimate the significance of this outcome for the left. Or Tsipras’ role in uniting groups that, famously, have remained outcast and fractured on the margins of Greek political life.Deploying unrivalled communication skills – with the help of US-trained speech writers and reputedly a New York based PR firm – the telegenic Tsipras has allowed Syriza to speak for a whole sector of society that was hounded and harassed for decades by authoritarian rightwing rule.In a nation still blighted by the fault lines of a bloody left-right civil war, both he and his alliance of Euro communists, socialists, Maoists, Trotskyists and Greens – since united into a single force – were barely known before the outbreak of Greece’s great economic crisis.Outside the eclectic world of Syriza committee meetings, congresses and conventions, the radical leftists were not a force to be reckoned with.“Some would say we have waited for nearly 200 years, the time Greece was formed, for this victory,” said Zisis Novis, an entrepreneur in his 50s.“My parents met in exile when they were banished to an island for their beliefs. My sister and I were both named after our uncle and aunt who were executed by the right.“You could say I was a leftist before I was even born. This is a wonderful, wonderful day.”But Syriza also knows that the hard work begins now. The international creditors keeping bankrupt Greece afloat are not going to be easy interlocutors.Punching the air, Tsipras arrived at a little after 11pm strutting up the steel stairs to the stage like a rock star.“The hard work begins tomorrow,” he boomed.“Today, the Greek people have written history. Hope has written history. Greece is turning a page. It is leaving behind the austerity of catastrophe.“There are no winners and losers.

She said that she asked what was in the capsule, and Cosby replied: “Trust me.” She said she spent the rest of the night in a “blur”.Ladd said that she woke up the next morning naked and in bed, and that Cosby was there, wearing a white bathrobe. “It was obvious to me that he had had sex with me,” she said. “I was horrified, embarrassed and ashamed. There was a mirror above the bed, which shocked me further.”Ladd writes that it never occurred to her to go to the police. “It was a different time and ‘date rape’ was a concept that didn’t exist. I just kept asking myself over and over in disbelief why this had happened to me. Other than my roommate, I did not discuss that night with anyone for 36 years.”The number of women who have come forward to put their names to similar allegations is now over 20, and include the supermodels Janice Dickinson and Beverly Johnson.As allegations mount against Cosby, some members of his former cast have come to his defence. On 7 January, Phylicia Rashad, who played his wife Claire Huxtable on the Cosby Show, spoke to Showbiz411 to defend her former co-star, calling it an “orchestrated” destruction of Cosby’s legacy.Martin Singer, an attorney representing Cosby, was not available for comment. Cosby’s attorney has consistently denied previous reports.Malcolm-Jamal Warner, who played Cosby’s son in the Cosby Show, said during an interview with Billboard on Thursday that it was “painful to hear any woman talk about sexual assault, whether true or not”, and added that it was “just as painful to watch my friend and mentor go through this”.In the meantime, Cosby continues his comedy tour “Cosby 77”, playing to a packed crowd in Denver last week.Demonstrators outside the show chanted “no means no”, and “Colorado believes the women”, but the crowd inside warmly welcomed the embattled star, according to the Associated Press. His next appearance is set to be in Sandusky, Ohio, on 30 January.In December 2014 Cosby resigned from the board of trustees of Temple University, on which he had served for 32 years.",Mon 26 Jan 2015 22.31 GMT,"['Bill Cosby', 'news']"

The competition will seek to foster “scholarly research on the Arab-Muslim world”, Dempsey said in a statement.Billed as a fitting tribute to the “life and leadership” of the Saudi monarch, the competition and award was the brainchild of General Dempsey himself.“General Dempsey saw this as a good opportunity to honor a key Arab partner,” said Richard Osial, the spokesman for the joint chiefs of staff. “He had a personal relationship with the king, this was somebody he knew; General Dempsey and his wife both lived in Saudi Arabia.”The essay competition is the latest act of flattery directed towards the kingdom and the reigning al-Sauds in recent days by the US, echoing the heavy praise heaped on the deceased 90-year-old monarch by western leaders. British prime minister David Cameron praised Abdullah for his “commitment to peace and for strengthening understanding between faiths”, as US secretary of state John Kerry called him a “man of wisdom and vision”. IMF head Christine Lagarde even called Abdullah a “strong advocate for women”.President Barack Obama, who will shorten his trip to India and divert to Saudi Arabia to pay his respects to the leader of the US’s staunchest Arab ally, saluted the king’s commitment to maintaining close ties with the US, offering effusive condolences. “As a leader, he was always candid and had the courage of his convictions,” Obama said in a statement.Praise for the king’s courage was echoed by Dempsey, who called the leader “a man of remarkable character and courage”. He first met Abdullah in 2001, when he was serving as US advisor to the Saudi Arabian national guard.In a string of fawning obituaries, the king has been described as a “reformer” and “modernist”, despite the country’s atrocious record on human rights under his reign.“Any evaluation of the king’s reign should consider what happens from a human rights perspective,” said Adam Coogle, a Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch. “There’s been a lot of eulogizing of the king, and certainly for the department of defence he was a great ally, but we should remember what actually took place during his reign.”Abdullah’s reign saw a general crackdown on all forms of domestic criticism, epitomized by the flogging of Saudi blogger Raif Badawi; a continuation of the guardianship system which gives women an almost absolute lack of independent rights; and mass campaigns of arrests and deportations of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers who reported abuse by Saudi authorities.But praise for the king from the Obama administration is “the least surprising thing in the last year”, Coogle said. “The US has always been incredibly reluctant to criticise the KSA; and while [the US administration] certainly understands and knows what is going on in the kingdom, the US just privileges economic and regional security concerns and puts human rights on the back of the line. It’s pretty much par for the course.”The competition will be administered during the upcoming academic year at NDU and will be open to all students. The competition will likely have a broad focus, and will call for an examination of US national security interests in the Arab and Muslim world, according to the Mark Phillips, a communications officer at NDU.More details on the competition were not yet available. But several Twitter users started a hashtag to highlight the absurdity of the competition, using #KingAbdullahEssays.",Mon 26 Jan 2015 21.35 GMT,"['King Abdullah', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Middle East and north Africa']"

It stands on the spot where 200 political activists – mostly communists – were executed by Nazi forces on May Day 1944. The monument in a rifle range in one of Athens’ “red” suburbs, is redolent of defiance but, perhaps more than that, the battle against tyranny. That Greece’s new prime minister Alexis Tsipras, Europe’s first radical left leader, should elect to visit the memorial minutes after being sworn in, is rich with symbolism – and defiance too. Red roses in hand, resistance veterans looking on, the young firebrand paid homage to the victims in his first act in office. “It represents national resistance to German occupation,” says Panos Skourletis, spokesman of Syriza, an alliance of far-left groups ranging from Maoists to greens. “But also the desire of Greeks for freedom, for liberty from German occupation.”If explanation were needed, he adds: “It was purely symbolic.”Tsipras, who at 40 becomes Greece’s youngest post-war leader, is a deft communicator with an army of (mostly) US-trained advisers. For a nation battered by German-inspired austerity and humiliated by international focus, standing up to Europe’s paymaster by whatever means plays well with the gallery.As the TV cameras rolled, Greek commentators couldn’t help themselves: “It’s another ‘up yours’ to the Germans,” one said.Tsipras told thousands of supporters in a victory speech on Sunday that he would seek to restore “their lost dignity”. For Greek leftists, widely persecuted after their defeat in the bloody civil war that followed the Wehrmacht’s withdrawal from Greece, such gestures are hugely significant.The men and women who were shot dead at dawn that day were killed in reprisal for the guerrilla ambush of a German general, Franz Krech, and three of his aides at Molaos, near Sparti, in the Peloponnese.Famously they began to sing – giving an uproarious rendition of the Greek national anthem – as they were lead to their deaths from the notorious SS-run camp at Haidari, then a suburb on the outskirts of Athens. German soldiers looked on astonished as the Greeks broke into song. Once at the range, the hostages refused to undress – insisting that they go dressed with dignity. It was an act of resistance that in austerity-whipped Greece resonates greatly today.",Mon 26 Jan 2015 21.22 GMT,"['Greece', 'Communism', 'Germany', 'European Union', 'Second world war', 'news']"

No compromise.”While he said the handing down of the death penalty came from the courts, and that those convicted could ask for amnesty, he added: “There will be no amnesty for drug dealers.”When pressed about whether Sukumaran and Chan may be spared, Widodo shook his head, CNN reported. “Eighteen thousand people die every year,” Widodo said. “I ask you, is it not more dangerous?”Chan and Sukumaran, both from Sydney, have spent the past decade in prison. They have been described by friends, family and even prison guards as model inmates who have reformed and helped to teach their fellow prisoners new skills, including English, art and computing. It is evidence of this reform their lawyers will present to the court in their final appeal.The director of the Centre for Indonesian Law at the University of Melbourne, Professor Tim Lindsey, told Guardian Australia that in 2007, Indonesia’s constitutional court recommended prisoners who had been on death row for 10 years, and for whom there was evidence of rehabilitation, have their sentences reviewed on appeal to the supreme court.“The difficulty is, the supreme court doesn’t consider itself bound by the constitutional court,” Lindsey said. “The supreme court and president have ignored the constitutional court so far by not considering rehabilitation.“The question is, how will the president exercise his powers? The president should be considering each application for clemency on merits rather than predetermining them, because the law gives every person that right, regardless of the nature of their offence.”Widodo’s latest comments on clemency were nothing new, Lindsey said. “It’s just a restatement of his position, and confirms he is unwilling to exercise his powers of clemency.“Widodo seems to have a social and moral position against drugs. There is no doubt drugs are a problem in Indonesia, and that the ‘war on drugs’ there has existed for some time.”A snap SMS Morgan poll shows Australians have mixed views when it comes to Australians convicted of drug trafficking overseas. The poll of a cross-section of 2,123 Australians surveyed between 23 and 27 January shows a small majority – 52% – believe Australians convicted of drug trafficking in another country and sentenced to death should be executed. And 62% said the Australian government should not do more to stop the execution of Sukumaran and Chan.A concert in support of the pair, organised by the award-winning artist Ben Quilty, will be held in Martin Place, Sydney, on Thursday night.",Tue 27 Jan 2015 23.39 GMT,"['Bali Nine', 'Bali', 'Joko Widodo', 'Indonesia', 'Drugs trade', 'Asia Pacific', 'news']"

The centre will sit alongside the memorial and feature the latest digital technology to bring together Britain’s network of Holocaust organisations.An endowment fund will be established to guarantee the long-term future of Holocaust education. As a priority a programme will be established to record the testimony of British Holocaust survivors.The prime minister, who was speaking at the British event to mark the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz, said at Methodist Central Hall: “Today we stand together – whatever our faith, whatever our creed, whatever our politics. We stand in remembrance of those who were murdered in the darkest hour of human history, we stand in admiration of what our Holocaust survivors have given to our country and we stand united in our resolve to fight prejudice and discrimination in all its forms.“Today – with the full support of the deputy prime minister and the leader of the opposition – I am accepting the recommendations of the Holocaust Commission. Britain will have a national memorial, a world-class learning centre and an endowment fund to secure Holocaust education forever.”Miliband said: “In the 1940s, both my parents fled the Nazis and several of my relatives – including my grandfather – were killed in the Holocaust. My family’s story is just one of millions of stories of men, women and children who were tragically murdered in the Holocaust because they were Jewish or a member of other persecuted groups. I’m pleased to support the Holocaust Commission’s recommendations because they will help ensure that the memories of those killed in the Holocaust live on, through a powerful memorial as well as long-term education and research programmes.“At a time of rising anti-Semitic attacks in Britain and across Europe, it is imperative that we remember what religious prejudice can lead to. I know that the Holocaust Commission recommendations will be instrumental in educating our future generations and in recording and preserving the stories of our Holocaust survivors and those who fought to liberate them.”Clegg said: “I would like to thank the Holocaust Commission for their excellent report. It is a great privilege to implement their recommendations and to commit £50m to build a new national Holocaust memorial and learning centre.”",Tue 27 Jan 2015 21.27 GMT,"['Holocaust', 'David Cameron', 'Ed Miliband', 'Nick Clegg', 'Religion', 'news']"
