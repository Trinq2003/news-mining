            "description": "BBC China editor Carrie Gracie witnesses one well-to-do man's surprising battle for legal rights.",
            "section": "China",
            "content": "In a one-party state, principles for citizens often seem like a dangerous and expensive luxury\n\nThe year 2016 has been another grim year for those campaigning for human rights in China.\n\nOn freedom of speech, religious expression, trades unions and a host of other issues, China's one-party state continues to punish those who try to insist on their constitutional rights.\n\nMeanwhile, through propaganda and censorship it works hard to nurture an unquestioning herd mentality and to discourage any exploration of individual values. But even in this unpromising landscape, defiance takes root in unlikely corners.\n\nWe were in the private dining room of a showy restaurant and the boss was already slurring his words. A large man with a level gaze, he'd finished one bottle of fine French wine and was moving on to a second.\n\nAs he lit a cigarette, two glasses went over like nine pins, one splashing red wine across the table and the other smashing on to the floor.\n\nIf influential people join the fight for legal rights - in between trips to London's casinos - then perhaps progress really is coming\n\nBut he barely seemed to notice and went on telling me how he'd loved London's casinos when he stopped off on the way back from visiting his daughter's British boarding school.\n\nImagine my surprise, then, when across the dishes stacked with roast duck and dumplings, this local Mr Big suddenly thrust at me a brown file full of well-thumbed papers.\n\n\"Fifteen years I've been fighting this miscarriage of justice,\" he declared. A handbrake turn from talk of boarding schools and casinos.\n\nHe told me he'd got embroiled in a factional power battle. One local Communist Party boss wanted him to dish the dirt on a rival.\n\nNine members of his family had been detained and interrogated and when he wouldn't sign statements incriminating the political target, he himself was jailed on charges of tax evasion.\n\nEven worse, a cousin had died mysteriously in police custody. By the time he'd got to the end of this grimly familiar story of crime and injustice, the second bottle of red wine was empty and we'd long run out of things to toast.\n\nNow I don't usually see it as my job to deliver unpalatable truths to provincial restaurant bosses. The private dining rooms of China have seen more coldblooded politics than I will ever conceive.\n\nBut I had eaten his dinner and the least I could do in return was point out that he would not win his battle for justice and instead would waste a lot of money and a lot of political capital in the process of losing.\n\n\"I don't care about the money!\" he replied. \"The innocent must never give up on justice. I'll campaign for this wrong to be righted till the day I die.\"\n\nWell that brought me up short. I'm not used to private citizens standing on principle in China, especially not rich people. After all, this is a huge, homogenising society under an authoritarian one-party state.\n\nPrinciples often seem like a dangerous and expensive luxury. Yes, Communist Party leaders make speeches about principles, but for the public that's even more reason to regard such talk as arrant hypocrisy.\n\nI'd even go so far as to say that many Chinese people today are actively intolerant or suspicious of those who stand up for values.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw may have written, \"the reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man\".\n\nBut you don't hear people quoting that in China. Instead there are plenty of proverbs telling people to keep their heads down or they'll get them lopped off.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw's unreasonable man is plain crazy in this worldview. Not someone heroic and brave, but a loser who will go down and probably take his family and friends with him.\n\nIt's not so surprising given that people with convictions are the enemy to a paranoid political class which regards alternative values as an existential challenge.\n\nBut at this dining table I was now rethinking my assumptions about the people standing up to the system and shrugging off the crazy tag.\n\nI'd recently met a renegade bishop who was defying both the Vatican and the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nAnd when I noted that many Roman Catholics were calling him crazy, he observed that people had called Jesus Christ crazy too.\n\nI'd observed brave human rights lawyers standing up for imprisoned colleagues. And young politicians in Hong Kong resisting Beijing's surreal version of democracy.\n\nBut the story that made me stop and think was this one among the wine stains and the scallops sprinkled with cigarette ash\u2026 a well-fed restaurant boss with so much to lose from upsetting local party bosses determined to join the ranks of George Bernard Shaw's unreasonable men and women.\n\nIf people like this join the fight for legal rights - in between their trips to London's casinos - then perhaps progress really is coming.",

            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nCeltic came from behind to beat Old Firm rivals Rangers and move 19 points clear at the top of the Premiership.\n\nKenny Miller slid in to convert James Tavernier's cross and put the home side ahead early on.\n\nMoussa Dembele's powerful shot from a Scott Sinclair corner flashed high into the net to bring Celtic level, and Dembele later fired against the bar.\n\nThe visitors dominated the second half, and Sinclair touched home Stuart Armstrong's low cross for the winner.\n\nMark Warburton's hosts showed from the outset their intention was to press their opponents in wide areas, and it paid dividends when Josh Windass released Tavernier to set up Miller's close-range finish.\n\nCeltic continued to concede too much space in the full-back areas, and further deliveries troubled goalkeeper Craig Gordon and his defence.\n\nHowever, Dembele's leveller put Celtic into the ascendancy and Rangers then struggled to get Barrie McKay and Tavernier on the ball, though McKay did draw a save from Gordon after the break.\n\nHaving struggled to get a telling delivery at set-pieces, Rangers may have gone ahead just before Celtic's second as Danny Wilson met Tavernier's corner, Gordon making the save.\n\nCeltic duo to the fore again\n\nSummer signings Dembele and Sinclair had run the Rangers defence ragged in September's 5-1 win at Celtic Park, and the duo's link-up play was again the catalyst as the visitors recovered from their early setback.\n\nSinclair's set-piece was controlled and rattled into the top-right corner by Celtic's top scorer Dembele - a fifth goal against Rangers for the Frenchman this season.\n\nAnd he should have taken that tally to six after Mikael Lustig squared the ball to the striker early in the second period, a miskick allowing Wes Foderingham to save.\n\nFoderingham came to Rangers' rescue when James Forrest was played in on goal by Stuart Armstrong but Sinclair would ensure a happy end to 2016 for his team, applying the finish to Armstrong's piercing ball across the face of goal.\n\nArmstrong, Sinclair and substitute Nir Bitton forced further saves from Foderingham as Rangers continued to struggle in defence.\n\nIn a match of so many chances, it was a surprise there were only three goals.\n\nSinclair fired against the right-hand post as Celtic trailed, and Dembele's downward volley bounced up on to the crossbar at 1-1, with Sinclair firing the rebound wide.\n\nAnd, after Sinclair had netted, Rangers were also left frustrated by the goal frame as Miller's shot came back off the same post Sinclair had hit in the opening half.\n\nThe Scottish Premiership enters its winter break for the early part of January and Celtic can extend their advantage at the top to 22 points if they win their game in hand against St Johnstone near the end of next month.\n\nThe league leaders, who have won 15 Premiership matches in a row and have only dropped two points all season, are targeting a sixth straight top-flight title win and a first under manager Brendan Rodgers.\n\nFor Rangers, they suffer their first competitive home defeat since September 2015 and face a battle to hold on to second place with Aberdeen, who have a game in hand, two points behind them.\n\u2022 None Attempt saved. Andy Halliday (Rangers) left footed shot from outside the box is saved in the top centre of the goal.\n\u2022 None Danny Wilson (Rangers) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.\n\u2022 None Moussa Dembele (Celtic) wins a free kick on the right wing.\n\u2022 None James Tavernier (Rangers) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.\n\u2022 None Attempt saved.

            "section": null,
            "content": "Roger Federer can return from six months out and win another Grand Slam, says his former coach Paul Annacone.\n\nThe 35-year-old, who has won 17 majors, is due to make his comeback from a knee injury against Britain's Dan Evans in the Hopman Cup in Perth on Monday.\n\nAnnacone, who coached the Swiss from 2010 to 2013, told BBC Sport: \"Last year was a very tough year for him and he still got to the semis of Wimbledon.\n\n\"There is no reason why he can't play at that level again.\"\n\nAnnacone believes Federer's best chance of another major title will come at SW19, where he has triumphed seven times.\n\nThe American added: \"When you look at his track record, particularly on grass, if he's healthy, it's going to be very difficult not to put him in the sentence as one of the favourites.\n\n\"Again, it's about staying healthy, but I absolutely think he can contend for a major title.\"\n\nFederer has not played since hurting his left knee as he lost in the Wimbledon semi-finals to Milos Raonic in July.\n\nHe is competing in the Hopman Cup team event with compatriot Belinda Bencic.\n\nFederer said he took six months off \"so I would be playing for hopefully another two to three years, not just another six months or so\".\n\nHaving had knee surgery in February 2016, he missed the French Open with a back problem and played only 28 matches in the year.\n\nHe last won a tournament in November 2015 - the Swiss Indoors - and has not won a Slam since Wimbledon 2012.\n\nAnnacone, who also coached 14-time major winner Pete Sampras and Britain's Tim Henman, believes Federer's extended absence \"could be a positive\".\n\nHe added: \"It's given him time to refresh and really get his body healthy.\n\n\"Six months isn't critical - it's not what I would call lethal. I know how hard Roger's worked and how professional and meticulous he is about his preparations.\n\n\"It is a challenge, but great players love challenges. I expect great things because he's a great player.\"\n\nFederer, who has spent 302 weeks as world number one, has fallen to 16th in the rankings, his lowest position since May 2001.\n\nThat means he could face Britain's world number one Sir Andy Murray or defending champion Novak Djokovic as early as the fourth round of the Australian Open, which starts on 16 January.\n\nHaving reached the semi-finals in Melbourne last year, an early exit would further impact on his ranking.\n\nAnnacone feels that will not matter to Federer at this stage of his career, citing the example of Sampras, who won the US Open in 2002 as the 17th seed.\n\n\"It's not ideal but I'm a glass half-full guy,\" said the 53-year-old. \"I would imagine if you talked to Andy or Novak they're not going to want to be playing Roger in the round of 16 or third round either.\n\n\"I was with Pete Sampras when he won his 2002 US Open. He hadn't won an event for 26 months. With these great players, you just don't know what they're capable of. The rules don't apply - they're merely suggestions.\n\n\"I remember it with Pete. He said: 'I really don't care what my ranking is, it doesn't matter any more. It's about can I put myself in position to win tournaments, and in particular major tournaments.' I'm sure Roger's approaching it the same way.\"\n\nAs if to underline that, Federer said on Friday: \"Winning titles is a beautiful feeling; rankings at the moment... completely secondary. As long as I'm healthy, I think I can really do some damage.\"\n\nCan he make more history?\n\nFederer, who has won more Grand Slams than any other male player, will be 36 in August, and Annacone says he does not need to chase history for motivation.\n\n\"I just think the sheer joy of competing and the challenge of testing himself against the others will be enough for Roger,\" he said. \"He's so at peace with what he's done and where he is that he'll do it organically by himself.\n\n\"If he stays healthy and is able to train and compete as often as he's planning to then I would consider that a success.\n\n\"If he does that, his average level, for how talented he is, is going to be somewhere in the top 10 anyway. If that's the case, that average level will create opportunities where he is playing at the end of events.\"\n\nAnnacone, who keeps in touch with Federer \"via texts and instant messaging\", says the Swiss has been \"in good spirits\".\n\n\"A couple of weeks ago he was doing great, he was really happy in his training in Dubai,\" he said. \"His body felt good and he was really excited about 2017.\"\n\nBut Annacone, who will be commentating on the Australian Open for Tennis Channel, says Federer must \"stay patient\" in the early stages of his comeback.\n\n\"He is so meticulous in his preparation that I expect him to play pretty terrific tennis pretty quickly,\" he added.\n\n\"Now can he do it second event in, the Australian Open, for seven matches? That's a big challenge but he's done it so many times in the past.\"",

            "section": "The Papers",
            "content": "Events in Turkey came too late for the early editions of the morning papers.\n\nThe Sunday Times leads with a warning from Home Office minister Ben Wallace that the self-styled Islamic State group could be planning a chemical weapons attack on the UK.\n\nIn an interview, Mr Wallace - who is responsible for security - says that while no specific plot has been identified, mass casualty attacks are an ambition for IS, which has reportedly used poison gas in Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe newspaper says that the risk of such an attack in Britain was noted last month by Europol, but this is the first time that a minister has highlighted the threat.\n\nThe main story for the Sunday Telegraph is the threat of extremists taking over charities to pursue violence.\n\nIt says the number of times the Charity Commission has referred concerns to the police and other agencies has almost trebled in three years to 630 - a record figure.\n\nThe Commission's chairman, William Shawcross, is calling for Muslim charities to help tackle threats of infiltration.\n\nThe Observer is predicting cross-party opposition in the Lords next week to the government's plans for higher education.\n\nIt says Labour, the Liberal Democrats and independent cross-bench peers have joined forces to scupper legislation that would make it easier for new colleges to award degrees, become universities and make profits from teaching.\n\nCritics fear the reforms would lower standards, but ministers argue that they will widen access.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday keeps up its attack on foreign aid spending, reporting that more than \u00a32m has been used to improve working conditions for farmers and factory workers in poorer countries.\n\nThe paper is outraged that grants were given to supermarkets, \"which make huge profits each year\", to provide training and healthcare to their overseas suppliers.\n\n\"Are they off their trolleys?\" asks the headline. The Department for International Development says the projects help developing countries' efforts to trade their way out of poverty.\n\nThe Sunday Express agrees with Theresa May that 2017 is a time for opportunity, not fear.\n\nIt talks of relishing the chance to change the country.\n\nThe Sun on Sunday applauds the prime minister's call for unity, but says wishing for it won't make it so.\n\nIt calls on those it says are \"still in denial about Brexit\" to \"stop and wake up\".\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph tells Mrs May she must start making choices and set out a clear case for the kind of Britain that will result from Brexit.\n\nIt argues that the British people will respond positively if she is \"direct and courageous\".\n\nThe papers mark the New Year in traditional fashion, with spectacular photographs of firework displays around the world.\n\nThe Sunday Mirror says the Australian city of Sydney put on a \"Purple Rainbow\" as a tribute to the late music star, Prince.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday has a photo of armed police in London - part of a big security operation which it says \"didn't spoil the 2017 party\".\n\nAmong the predictions, both the Sun on Sunday and the Mail on Sunday are tipping marriage for Prince Harry.\n\nThe Sunday People has its tongue firmly in its cheek with its forecasts, however: apocalypse; Nigel Farage as the new face of Eurovision; and Boris Johnson being knocked out in the first round of Strictly.",
