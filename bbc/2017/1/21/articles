            "description": "An appeal over a post-Brexit trade deal was met with sniggers in Berlin, Damien McGuinness writes.",
            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Two British officials failed to win favour from German business leaders in Berlin\n\nThe distinguished audience members were too polite to heckle. But the eye rolling, frowns and audible tutting made it quite clear how the Brexiteers' message was going down with German business leaders.\n\nOwen Paterson, a former minister and Conservative MP, and John Longworth, co-chair of Leave Means Leave, came to Berlin on Saturday with a clear mission - to persuade German business leaders to lobby Chancellor Angela Merkel to give Britain a good trade deal.\n\nThey should have been on safe territory.\n\nThe two men are confident, witty speakers with impressive business and free-trade credentials.\n\nMr Longworth is a former head of the British Chamber of Commerce. Mr Paterson's years spent trading in Germany meant he could open his address with a few remarks in German - which drew an appreciative round of applause - and a well-judged joke about multilingual trade.\n\nBut it turned out they had entered the lion's den.\n\nThe laughter from the audience quickly turned to sniggers as they heard the UK described as \"a beacon of open, free trade around the world\".\n\nWestminster's decision to leave the world's largest free trade area does not look like that to Germany.\n\nWhen Europe was blamed for spending cuts and a lack of British health care provision, there were audible mutters of irritation from the audience.\n\nThe occasional light-hearted attempts at EU-bashing - usually guaranteed to get a cheap laugh with some British audiences - was met with stony silence.\n\nBrexiteers argue German manufacturers will want to still sell to UK customers\n\nIn another setting - at another time - this gathering of the elite of Germany's powerful business community would have lapped up the British wit.\n\nEvery ironic quip would ordinarily have had them rolling in the aisles. But British charm does not travel well these days.\n\nRattled by the economic havoc Brexit could unleash, Germans are not in the mood for gags.\n\nBritain used to be seen by continentals as quirky and occasionally awkward - but reliably pragmatic on the economy.\n\nHowever, since the Brexit vote, Europeans suspect endearing eccentricity has morphed into unpredictable irrationality. The UK has become the tipsy, tweedy uncle, who after too much Christmas sherry has tipped over into drunkenly abusive bore.\n\nWhen the audience was asked how many of them welcomed Brexit, only one hand went up - and it turned out that belonged to a businessman who wanted more EU reform and was fed up with Britain slowing things down.\n\nBrexiteer rhetoric over the past year has often focused on the size of Britain's market and how keen German manufacturers are to sell to British customers.\n\nMany leave campaigners remain convinced that German business leaders will force Mrs Merkel to grant the UK a special free trade deal in order not to lose British trade.\n\nBut that's not what's happening.\n\nAngela Merkel has said Britain will not be able to cherry-pick the best bits of the single market\n\nInstead German firms are remarkably united in their support of the chancellor in her rejection of British \"cherry-picking\" - even if it means losing business in the short-term.\n\nWhen you talk to German bosses they say their top priority is in fact the integrity of the single market, rather than hanging on to British customers.\n\nThat's because their supply chains span across the EU.\n\nA German car might be designed in Germany, manufactured in Britain, with components made in various parts of eastern Europe, to be sold in France. This only works if there are no cross-border tariffs, paperwork or red tape.\n\nGerman companies - more often family-owned and with deeper connections to their regional heartlands - tend to look at the wider picture, sometimes thinking more long-term.\n\nThey supported Mrs Merkel on sanctions against Russia over Ukraine, even though that meant a blow to trade. The financial hit was deemed less bad for business than worsening unrest in nearby Ukraine.\n\nThe same calculations are being made over Brexit.\n\nTheresa May's speech on Brexit last week made front page news in Germany\n\nThis doesn't mean German business is thinking politically, and not economically. But rather, it indicates a wider attitude towards how business can thrive long-term.\n\nGerman business leaders tell you that the British market may be important. But it is only one market, compared to 27 markets in the rest of the EU.\n\nLeave campaigners also still underestimate the political and historical significance of the EU for Germany, where it is seen as the guarantor of peace after centuries of warfare.\n\nIt is tempting to see the clashes between Westminster and the EU27 as one big decades-long misunderstanding of what the EU is.\n\nAn idealistic peace-project versus a pragmatic free-trade zone. This makes it even more ironic that London may reject the free-trade area it spent so much time creating.\n\nGermany was shocked and saddened by the UK's vote to leave the EU. But the decision was quickly accepted in Berlin.\n\n\"The Brits never really wanted to be members of the European Union anyway,\" is something you often hear these days.\n\nMany Germans now want to just work out a solution that does the least amount of harm to the European economy. Hence the irritation in Germany when British politicians keep rehashing the pre-referendum debate.\n\n\"It was frustrating to hear the same old arguments from the referendum campaign,\" one business leader told me when I asked him what he had thought about Saturday's discussion.\n\nGermany has moved on, he said. Maybe Britain should too.\n\nThe Brexiteers might not have persuaded their audience in Berlin. But if they return to London with a better idea of the mood in Germany's business community, then the trip may well have been worthwhile.",

            "description": "US President Donald Trump's inaugural address comes under focus on Saturday's front pages.",
            "section": "The Papers",
            "content": "The papers are dominated by coverage of the US presidential inauguration - with every front page featuring a picture of Donald Trump.\n\nMr Trump, says the Times, unveiled a new era - but it notes that the imagery was unusually dark for an inaugural address, with the president describing crime-ridden inner cities, catastrophic levels of drug addiction, and rusted-out factories.\n\nThe Daily Mirror describes it as a \"chilling inaugural speech\" in which Mr Trump vowed to put the United States first - \"and to hell with every other country\".\n\nThe Daily Mail says it was an incendiary speech, that both electrified and divided his nation.\n\nIt points out the the new president had been expected to finally go easy on the vitriol and enjoy the pomp and ceremony of the event. But it says he used the speech to fire both barrels at the political establishment.\n\nIn the view of the Financial Times, the new president made a defiant and uncompromising address, in which he promised to revive the country with an aggressive rejection of globalisation. The paper says his inauguration marked the end of an incredible journey that was propelled by a groundswell of populism.\n\nThe Sun says more than a billion people watched the swearing in of the new president on TV, with 900,000 spectators on the National Mall in Washington to witness Mr Trump give a thumbs up and fist pump. However the paper notes that the crowd in Washington was only half of that which saw Barack Obama become the first black president in 2009.\n\nWriting in the Guardian, Gary Younge says there was no higher calling, no sense of a greater purpose, and no impassioned idealism. He describes the first words of Mr Trump's presidency as a \"crude and unapologetic appeal to nationalism\".\n\nIn the i, Michael Day describes the address as \"lousy\" and says \"it hardly made the heart soar\".\n\nThe editorials have mixed messages for President Trump.\n\nThe Sun says that now he is in the Oval Office, he may be stunned by the complexity of many of the problems he faces. It notes that plenty of people will write him off - but says that President Reagan was written off too - before he changed the world.\n\nThe Daily Mail claims his speech was \"truly astonishing\" - as he tore up the rule book and delivered an inauguration address unlike any heard before.\n\nThe Daily Express asserts that the progressive left-leaning programme, which seemed woven into Western democracy, is now being unravelled. It says this is a profound change, which will affect us all.\n\nAccording to the Daily Telegraph, the inaugural address was what Mr Trump's supporters had gathered in their thousands to hear. But it says that for outsiders, it was an unsettling speech that seemed to presage the emergence of an inward-looking, isolationist America.\n\nThe Daily Mirror says the US and the rest of the world should be \"very afraid\" following what it describes as the new president's \"rambling, pugnacious and protectionist speech\".\n\nThe Guardian is equally horrified, saying his America First nationalism was both \"crude and shameless\". It concludes the reality of a Trump presidency is a \"terrifying prospect\".\n\nA number of papers also leave space to comment on the person whose day it could have been: Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe Daily Mail says protocol demanded she attended the inauguration with her husband - and her solemn face showed the strain as she arrived at the US Capitol.\n\nThe Daily Express observes the former first lady looked more like she was attending a funeral.\n\nFor the Guardian, Mrs Clinton stood stoically as chants of \"lock her up\" emanated from the crowd. However, on a more positive note, it adds that she left the ceremony waving to supporters and smiling broadly.\n\nFinally - despite their disagreements about President Trump - the papers all seem united on one point.\n\nThe Daily Mirror,Daily Express and the Sun all declare that the stand-out person at Friday's events was the new First Lady, Melania Trump.\n\nMany commentators, including the fashion director of the Daily Telegraph, compare her to Jackie Kennedy.\n\nThe Guardian says she wore a sleek ice blue dress and jacket, which was custom-made by US designer Ralph Lauren.\n\nFor the Daily Mail, she did not put a foot wrong, describing her as the \"dazzling new First Lady\".",

They complained that the National Park Service undercounted attendance at the march.\n\nMore people turned out to witness Mr Trump and his entourage travelling along Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House on Friday afternoon.",

            "content": "For such a divisive figure, Donald Trump managed to unify hundreds of thousands of Americans at the Women's March on Washington.\n\nMoments after Mr Trump was sworn in as the 45th president on Friday, he delivered a thundering speech in which he promised to improve the lives of millions of Americans.\n\nA day later, throngs of women, men and children streamed into the same area where he made that pledge, in order to take a stand for gender and racial equality.\n\nThough Mr Trump's named was mentioned frequently, the march, which organisers estimate attracted more than half a million, was not only about the new US president.\n\nMessages ranged from \"Thank you for making me an activist Trump\" to \"We will not be silenced,\" but the common thread throughout the patchwork of signs was hope.\n\n\"It's about solidarity and visualising the resistance,\" said Jonathon Meier, who took a bus from New York.\n\n\"And I think it not only helps with the healing process, but it gives me hope for the next four years.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Washington DC is leading anti-Trump protests around the world.\n\nA sea of activists, some clad in knitted, pink \"pussy\" hats and others draped in American flags, ambled about the National Mall, stopping to catch a glimpse of some of the high-profile speakers and singing along to songs like \"This Little Light of Mine\".\n\nPeppered among the many protest signs were images of ovaries and female genitals, a nod to concerns over losing access to birth control and abortion care under a Trump administration.\n\nJellema Stewart, who travelled from Buffalo, New York, said she was marching for her grandmother, who died at age 38 during an illegal abortion in the 1950s.\n\n\"I'm here to make sure her voice is heard,\" she said. \"I marched in 2004 for reproductive rights and it's now 2017 and we're still fighting for the same thing.\"\n\nMs Stewart also said she was energised by thousands at the rally, insisting that it sends a message to the new president.\n\n\"He gave racism a voice again,\" she said of Mr Trump. \"So we have to be louder than the racism and discrimination that came out of this election and show him that we are definitely a force. To show him that we count and we will be watching.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAll eyes across the world seemed to be watching, not only the march in Washington, but the dozens of other sister marches that took place in more than 60 countries.\n\nAerial images showed thousands massing in so-called \"solidarity marches\" in the UK, Canada, and Australia as well as in US cities including New York, Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles.\n\nFor demonstrator Chrystian Woods, the marches signalled that the US would not be defined by who was in White House.\n\n\"It's not about being anti-Trump,\" she explained.\n\n\"It's letting the world know that America is more than just that. America is love, inclusiveness and unity and that America is accepting people who are not like us.\"\n\n\"I believe deeply this country is for all of us,\" said Brooklyn resident Amy Briggs.\n\n\"I would have been very dejected yesterday if I wasn't able to be here and experience this solidarity,\" she said as a young female approached her to sign a rainbow flag.\n\nThe mood was festive among the peaceful protesters, but some were cautious about what comes after the pink hats come off.\n\nLeigh Caputo, a Baltimore public school teacher, said she did not want people to think a march was the only solution.\n\n\"I'm hopeful that this [march] mobilises people because there's a lot of work to be done,\" said Ms Caputo.\n\nIn the months leading up to the event, the organisers faced intense scrutiny over claims that the name exploited past African-American movements and catered to white women.\n\nCritics on Facebook told white women to \"check their privilege\", leading to heated discussions about racial divisions and what the march could achieve.\n\nIt is difficult to ignore the fact that 53% of white women did vote for Mr Trump while the female half of more than 90 million eligible voters did not cast a ballot at all. So what about the sea of white women at the march?\n\nLesley Mansfield, who travelled from Sante Fe, New Mexico, agreed that it was puzzling that so many women voted for Mr Trump.\n\n\"It's a reality we have to be aware of,\" she said. \"But being here reminds us that there are people who think like we do - like the majority who voted for Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nThose sobering statistics did not seem to loom over those in attendance on Saturday, and like the Trump supporters who stood in the same spot 24 hours earlier, they were full of hope for America's future.",

            "description": "The BBC's Peter Taylor looks back as Martin McGuinness retires from frontline politics.",
            "section": "Northern Ireland",
            "content": "The political retirement of Martin McGuinness on Thursday due to ill health marks the end of a remarkable journey. Perceived by some as a terrorist, others as a freedom fighter, he ended up a statesman, a journey similar to those previously made by other historical figures from Menachem Begin to Jomo Kenyatta and Nelson Mandela.\n\nIt also marks the closing of a chapter in Northern Ireland's turbulent history in which Mr McGuinness played a crucial role both as perhaps the most important IRA leader on the island of Ireland and one of its most skilled and charismatic politicians. Without his endeavours, in umbilical political partnership with his former comrade-in- arms, Gerry Adams, I doubt if Northern Ireland, despite the continuing fragility of its institutions, would be where it is today.\n\nI first met Martin McGuinness 45 years ago this month, shortly after the day that became notorious as Bloody Sunday when British paratroops shot dead 13 civil rights marchers in the Bogside enclave of Londonderry/Derry.\n\nI remember watching a candle-lit procession on its way to the church where the coffins of the dead were lying and being told by the nationalist politician, John Hume, to keep an eye on one of the mourners.\n\nHe pointed to Martin McGuinness. I followed his advice and soon met him on the steps of the gasworks that served as the IRA's headquarters in the Bogside. At the time he was second in command of the IRA's Derry Brigade. He was soon to become its commander.\n\nHe did not fit the stereotypical role of an IRA commander at the time. He was personable, highly articulate and utterly committed to his cause of getting the \"Brits\" out of the North.\n\nA few months later, following an IRA ceasefire, he was sitting down in a posh house in Chelsea, along with Gerry Adams, as part of the IRA delegation that met the Northern Ireland Secretary, Willie Whitelaw. The IRA said it wanted a British withdrawal by 1975. Not surprisingly, the talks got nowhere and it was back to the \"war\".\n\nIf anyone had looked into a crystal ball at that time and told me that the young IRA commander would go on to become Northern Ireland's deputy prime minister, sharing power and joking, as \"the chuckle brothers\" with his former arch enemy, Ian Paisley, and then would don white tie and tails to dine with the Queen at Windsor Castle, I would have said that pigs might fly. But pigs did.\n\n\"The chuckle brothers\" - Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness at the Northern Ireland Assembly, 2007\n\nMr McGuinness's role was critical in persuading the IRA's rank-and-file that \"armed struggle\" had run its course and the future road to Sinn Fein's holy grail of a united Ireland lay in sharing power at Stormont with its unionist opponents.\n\nThis was tantamount to accepting partition (the division of Ireland in 1922 into two states) and the role of the British state - albeit, as far as Sinn Fein is concerned, a temporary accommodation as a means to an end.\n\nRemarkably Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness finally persuaded the majority of the IRA to swallow the political heresy and agree to the ceasefire of 1994 that was to lead on to the Good Friday Agreement four years later.\n\nA measure of the faith and trust that rank-and-file IRA men and women had in Martin McGuinness is reflected in the sentiment I heard from many of them that \"if it's good enough for Martin, it's good enough for us\". Such sentiments speak volumes of Mr McGuinness and the esteem in which he was held as IRA leader.\n\nThese landmark steps were only made possible as a result of a protracted and fraught secret back-channel dialogue, via an intermediary, between MI6 and MI5 in which Mr McGuinness was the key conduit to the IRA's ruling Army Council.\n\nBut Mr McGuinness, because of his IRA past, remains a controversial figure. There are still some Unionists who would take issue with the tribute paid by Ian Paisley's son who said that by working with his father, Martin McGuinness had \"saved lives\" and \"made countless lives better\".\n\nHis critics can only see him as the former leader of a terrorist organisation responsible for a grievous toll of death and destruction. They will never forget - or forgive the IRA - for the lives of the hundreds of policemen, soldiers and civilians murdered in the IRA's campaign and the number of families who have been left bereft.\n\nBut for me, the true recognition of the journey Mr McGuinness has made came in an interview I did with the mother of Marie Wilson, the young woman who died in the IRA's bomb attack on the Remembrance Day parade in Enniskillen in 1987.\n\nThe intelligence services believe that Martin McGuinness, although he denies it, was at that time the acting head of the IRA's Northern Command that prosecuted the \"war\" in the North.\n\nIn words of moving candour, Mrs Wilson said she respected Mr McGuinness's role in helping to bring the conflict to end and making such attacks, she hoped, a thing of the past.\n\u2022 None McGuinness will not stand in NI election",

            "description": "Long before Donald Trump became US president, he was just \"The Donald\", celebrity and property tycoon.",
            "section": "US Election 2016",
            "content": "Long before he was a contender for the US presidency, Donald Trump was America's most famous and colourful billionaire.\n\nOnce considered a long shot for the presidency, the 74-year-old is now out of office after a single term - but he remains a force within the Republican party.\n\nScepticism over his candidacy for the 2016 election had stemmed not only from his controversial platform on immigration and outrageous campaign style but from his celebrity past.\n\nYet the businessman had the last laugh when he defied all predictions to beat much more seasoned politicians in the Republican primary race.\n\nHe then went a step further by winning the presidential election, one of the most divisive and controversial contests in living memory, against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nMr Trump is the fourth child of New York real estate tycoon Fred Trump. Despite the family's wealth, he was expected to work the lowest-tier jobs within his father's company and was sent off to a military academy at age 13 when he started misbehaving in school.\n\nAfter attending the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania he became favourite to succeed his father when his older brother, Fred, chose to become a pilot. Fred Trump died at 43 from alcoholism, an incident that his brother says led him to avoid alcohol and cigarettes his entire life.\n\nMr Trump says he got into real estate with a \"small\" $1m loan from his father before joining the company. He helped manage his father's extensive portfolio of residential housing projects in the New York City boroughs, and took control of the company - which he renamed the Trump Organization - in 1971.\n\nHis father died in 1999. \"My father was my inspiration,\" Mr Trump said at the time.\n\nShifting his family's business from residential units in Brooklyn and Queens to glitzy Manhattan projects, Mr Trump transformed the rundown Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt and erected the most famous Trump property, the 68-storey Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. Other properties bearing the famous name followed - Trump Place, Trump World Tower, Trump International Hotel and Tower, and so on. There are Trump Towers in Mumbai, Istanbul and the Philippines.\n\nAnd Mr Trump developed hotels and casinos, an arm of the business that has led to four bankruptcy filings (for the businesses, not personal bankruptcy).\n\nHe also built an empire in the entertainment business. From 1996 until 2015, he was an owner in the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants. In 2003, he debuted an NBC reality television show called The Apprentice, in which contestants competed for a shot at a management job within Mr Trump's organisation. He hosted the show for 14 seasons, and said in a financial disclosure form that he had been paid a total of $213m by the network during the show's run.\n\nHe has written several books, and owns a line of merchandise that sells everything from neckties to bottled water. According to Forbes, his net worth is $2.5bn (\u00a31.9bn).\n\nIn September, the New York Times reported that despite his purported wealth, Mr Trump paid just $750 in federal income tax both in 2016 and in his first year in the White House. The former president dismissed the report as \"fake news\".\n\nMr Trump has been married three times, though his most famous wife was his first - Ivana Zelnickova, a Czech athlete and model. The couple had three children - Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric - before they filed for divorce in 1990. The ensuing court battle made for numerous stories in the tabloid press. Those stories included allegations that he was abusive towards Ivana, though she later downplayed the incidents.\n\nHe married actress Marla Maples in 1993. They had a daughter named Tiffany before divorcing in 1999. He married his current wife, Slovenian model Melania Knauss, in 2005, and the couple have one son, Barron William Trump.\n\nTrump with his wife Melania and children at his campaign announcement\n\nHis children from his first marriage now help run Trump Organization, though he is still chief executive. Ivanka, his eldest daughter, followed her dad to the White House, where she and her husband, Jared Kushner, served as senior advisers.\n\nMr Trump expressed interest in running for president as early as 1987, and even entered the 2000 race as a Reform Party candidate.\n\nAfter 2008, he became one of the most outspoken members of the \"birther\" movement, which questioned whether Barack Obama had been born in the US. Those claims have been thoroughly debunked; Mr Obama was born in Hawaii. Mr Trump finally admitted there was no truth to the claims although, characteristically, there was no apology.\n\nIt was not until June 2015 that Mr Trump formally announced his entrance into the race for the White House.\n\n\"We need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. We can do that,\" he said in his announcement speech, promising that as a candidate with no need to fundraise he answered to no special interests and was the perfect outsider candidate.\n\nUnder the banner Make America Great Again, Mr Trump ran a controversial campaign built on promises to strengthen the American economy, build a wall on the border of Mexico and the US, and to temporarily ban immigration by Muslims \"until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on\".\n\nDespite massive protests at his campaign events and the best efforts of his Republican rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, Mr Trump became the presumptive Republican Party nominee for president after the Indiana primary.\n\nFew expected to ever see Trump in the Oval Office\n\nMr Trump's 2016 campaign for the presidency was rocked by controversies, including the emergence of a recording from 2005 of him making lewd remarks about women, and claims, including from members of his own party, that he was not fit for office.\n\nBut he consistently told his army of supporters that he would defy the opinion polls, which mostly had him trailing Hillary Clinton, and that his presidency would strike a blow against the political establishment and \"drain the swamp\" in Washington.\n\nHe took inspiration from the successful campaign to get Britain out of the European Union, saying he would pull off \"Brexit times 10\".\n\nIt was something few pundits believed would happen as polling day approached, despite his campaign receiving a late boost from fresh controversy over an FBI investigation into his opponent's emails.\n\nAs his stunning victory was still sinking in across the US, his supporters got the chance to see him in the Oval Office when he and President Obama met for transition talks two days after election day.\n\nHe is the first US president never to have held elected office or served in the military, meaning that he had already made history before he was sworn in as America's 45th president on 20 January 2017.\n\nMr Trump's presidency has been marked by the coronavirus pandemic - and his own infection\n\nMuch like his candidacy, Donald Trump's presidency was marked by drama and controversy.\n\nIn January 2017, he signed his first executive order, banning travel from seven countries, most with Muslim-majorities. The ban, decried as xenophobic by critics, has been upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nMonths later, he shocked Washington by firing FBI Director James Comey. The sudden dismissal was described as potentially obstructing justice in a subsequent report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, which probed alleged collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia. The two-year long investigation did not establish criminal collusion.\n\nSoon after, Mr Trump faced accusations that he had pressured a foreign government to dig up dirt on Democratic rival Joe Biden. The allegations prompted a Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, and Mr Trump became just the third US president in history to be impeached.\n\nBut Mr Trump maintained his loyal base thanks to a number of campaign promises kept. Perhaps his most enduring legacy: nominating three right-wing justices to the Supreme Court, which will shape the country's policies for decades to come.\n\nHis 2020 election year was dominated by the coronavirus pandemic. He faced intense criticism for his handling of the crisis, as the US leads the globe in deaths and infections. The voracious campaigner was even forced to take a break from the trail in October, after he was diagnosed with Covid-19 himself.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. US President Donald Trump on Covid-19 in his own words\n\nHe eventually lost the election to Democratic rival Joe Biden, though Mr Trump received 74 million votes, more than any other presidential candidate except for Mr Biden, who got seven million more.\n\nBut Mr Trump's unsubstantiated allegations of widespread electoral fraud and claims that votes were stolen, made after the election, led to him making history of a different kind.\n\nHis historic second impeachment - a first for an American president - was on a charge that he incited a mob to storm the US Capitol on 6 January, 2021. That riot followed a \"Save America\" rally, which Mr Trump addressed, that was organised to challenge the result of the presidential election.\n\nThe former president was later acquitted by the Senate. Mr Trump has continued influence over the party despite some senior politicians distancing themselves recently, and has hinted he might consider running for a second term.",

            "section": "US & Canada",
            "content": "Donald Trump campaigned on becoming a president unlike any Washington has ever seen. With his inauguration speech, he's already set the tone.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump posted a photo of himself sitting at a desk at Mar-a-Largo, a permanent marker hovering over a notepad.\n\n\"Writing my inaugural address at the Winter White House, Mar-a-Lago, three weeks ago. Looking forward to Friday,\" he tweeted.\n\nIt's unclear whether the president-elect actually wrote the speech himself, but the content was pure Trump: the same populist message that resonated throughout the primaries and the campaign.\n\n\"Today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people,\" he said at the beginning of his remarks.\n\nFor some on Twitter, it bore an eerie similarity to the Batman villain Bane's speech in The Dark Night Rises, so much so that someone posted a 10-second mash-up of the two.\n\nBut such snarky reactions, warned Fox News commentator Guy Benson, underestimate how popular his rhetoric is with Trump supporters.\n\n\"People panning the speech still don't seem to understand how resonant the 'I will never ignore you' theme has been, and still is,\" he wrote, referencing Trump's many callouts to those who feel left out of American progress.\n\nTrump spoke of a country whose citizens had too long been ignored by the coastal elite: \"Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.\"\n\nHe painted a picture of a broken and damaged country, dotted with rusting-out factories \"like tombstones\", city streets plagued with \"crime and the gangs, and the drugs that have stolen too many lives,\" and the wealth of the middle class \"ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world\".\n\nIt was an unusually bleak speech for an inaugural address.\n\nAccording to MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, the speech was not intended to follow tradition: \"Donald Trump's speech was not an inaugural address. It was a primal scream aimed at Washington, DC.\"\n\nAuthor Hugh Hewitt called it \"authentic, determined, almost grim\". He wrote, \"I expected more joy, but it cannot be said that POTUS @realDonaldTrump said anything he hasn't said before. He has a plan and it's going to roll out fast.\"\n\nOthers were sceptical of the breadth of those plans. Trump said the country was poised to \"free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow\", as well as \"eradicate from the face of the Earth\" radical Islamic terrorism.\n\nWriter Ben Shapiro expressed doubt about Trump's plans to both take power away from DC, and use his position as President to steer trade and create jobs.\n\n\"These cannot both be true,\" he wrote.\n\nMany also noted that it's easy to campaign as an outsider, railing about America's problems, but harder to lead, when one must find solutions.\n\n\"After three months in which Trump is president and it's still the same Washington, that speech is going to seem wildly imprudent,\" wrote Noah Rothman, assistant editor at Commentary Magazine.\n\nCommentator Mary Katherine Hahn thinks voters aren't interested in sweeping rhetoric. \"I am unabashedly ideological. The country is not. His message is populist & popular. His opponents dismiss that at their political peril.\"\n\nPollster Frank Luntz said President Trump seemed to pivot, if not in tone then at least in substance: \"President Trump's inaugural speech was the best delivery I've ever seen from him.\"\n\nA more well-known conservative kept mum on his opinion. When the Washington Post asked George W Bush what he thought of the speech, he merely replied, \"Good to see you.\"\n\nOne high-profile Twitter user was an unabashed fan. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke tweeted multiple times in favour of Trump's speech.",

He's openly misogynistic and racist as well. I see America as a leader and partners in the Western world. He represents such a big nation.\n\n\"Our leaders over here are right wing as well. It's not going the right way for me.\n\n\"Brexit is a concern. I hope we protect the rights the EU offers, such as employment rights and maternity. These issues need to be spoken about. When a nation is doing badly, women suffer.\n\n\"Personally I want my daughter to see what I've done today to show you can do things to change the world and she does have the power.\"\n\nIt was a message which resonated with many other parents as they walked with their children in the fresh winter's air along Piccadilly.\n\nThe march had many parents attending with their children\n\nNancy Pegg, 39, a mum-of-two from south-west London, came along with her daughter Sophie, nine, who carried a yellow banner emblazoned with the words \"Yes to equality\".\n\nShe said: \"This is about equality for girls not in a fortunate position.\n\n\"Trump is a concern but empowering women is the main motivation. I think it's important for my daughter to have a powerful voice and to know she can be a strong force.\n\n\"We live in a male-dominated world. I want to show her anything her brother can do, she can do too. There are no boundaries.\"\n\nAlthough the event was labelled a Women's March, there were hundreds of men in the crowd showing their support.\n\nCar horns beeped to galvanise the demonstrators who, in turn, greeted the drivers with cheers as the march progressed to its rally in Trafalgar Square.\n\nThe Raise Voices Choir motivated the protesters by singing \"Don't let Trump get his way\" to their own version of \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\".\n\nStudent Patrick Bone, from Shepherd's Bush, London, attended because he felt \"progress made in the last decades is in threat of being eroded\".\n\nHe added: \"Trump's election signalled a rise of the populist right who look to blame economic problems on minorities or disenfranchised groups.\n\n\"His election was a catalyst for something that's been coming a long time.\n\n\"This march is to show we will stand and be counted. This is only the beginning. The work begins today.\"\n\nTom Amies, 33, a doctor from Middlesex, walked beside his wife Lydia, 34, as he carried their 11-month-old daughter Niamh in a baby carrier sling.\n\n\"This is for my daughter, he said.\n\n\"There has been a political slide to the right and a sense of misplaced trust. Trump wants to repeal Obamacare. It shows how good we have it with the NHS.\n\n\"There are going to be people there who have that healthcare for life-saving treatment and they will no longer be able to afford it.\"\n\nLydia Amie, husband Tom and daughter Niamh attended the march as a family\n\nThe demonstration brought representatives from all nationalities, including Americans who felt they needed to take a stand even though they were thousands of miles away from their country.\n\nRetired banker Carol Moore, 68, originally from New York, came to represent the Democrats Abroad UK Women's Caucus.\n\nShe said: \"I've come because of the horror of seeing Donald Trump win. He is divisive and will hurt the middle classes by repealing the healthcare act.\n\n\"This march has taken on huge visibility here in the UK because the issues are global. Women's pay was an issue when I worked in the City.\n\n\"There is still the issue of sexual violence and how it's prosecuted and handled here.\n\n\"I hope this is a message to women to recognise they have a voice to fight issues here in the UK and around the world.\"\n\nBusiness development manager Anna McDermott, 29, originally from California, has been in the UK for 11 years.\n\nShe said: \"As an American, I cannot accept what Donald Trump says and I can't accept him as a president.\n\n\"I do hope this sends out a message. 'Good morning. Welcome to day one of the resistance. This is the world shouting back'.\"\n\nAs the crowd moved into Trafalgar Square, the noise quietened so demonstrators could listen to the speakers on the stage, who included TV presenter Sandi Toksvig and Labour MP Yvette Cooper.\n\nHowever, the final address was given by 10-year-old Sumayah Siddiqi who read out a poem to the crowd which had a message of optimism with the words \"I shall stand for love\".\n\nSumayah Siddiqi addressed the crowds at the Women's March",

            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nSwansea lifted themselves off the bottom of the Premier League table and dealt a huge blow to Liverpool's title hopes with a thrilling win at Anfield.\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson scored from close range with 16 minutes left to give Paul Clement his first win as Swans boss and the club their first away league victory over the Reds.\n\nRoberto Firmino had struck twice to draw the hosts level after Fernando Llorente's two goals in four minutes after the break.\n\nThe defeat leaves Liverpool seven points behind leaders Chelsea, who now have a game in hand, at home against Hull on Sunday.\n\nThe Tigers are one of three teams, along with Sunderland and Crystal Palace, leapfrogged by Swansea, who move up to 17th after only their second win in eight league games.\n\nIn the wake of last weekend's demoralising 4-0 defeat by Arsenal, Clement said Swansea would be \"naive\" to ignore the possibility of Premier League relegation this season.\n\nOn the evidence of their performance at Anfield, it would be equally naive of anyone to write them off.\n\nIn the space of seven days they have gone from a side who collapsed at the first setback to one capable of rallying under extreme pressure.\n\nTheir first-half defensive display - which saw them restrict Liverpool to a couple of half-chances - belied their status as the club with the division's most porous defence.\n\nTheir second-half performance was clinical, epitomised by Llorente's two strikes - a close-range finish following Federico Fernandez's header from a corner, followed by a header from Tom Carroll's cross - and Sigurdsson's decisive, well-placed finish. These were their only three efforts on target.\n\nIt was also gutsy. They had to dig very deep against a side who, before Saturday, were unbeaten in the league in over a year at home and who had scored 26 goals in their previous nine league games.\n\nIn the programme for this match, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp described October's encounter with Swansea in Wales - a 2-1 win sealed by a late James Milner penalty - as \"one of the toughest we have had all season.\"\n\nThe German may feel the need to revise that after Saturday's game.\n\nDespite having Philippe Coutinho back in the side - and ending the game with Divock Origi and Daniel Sturridge on the pitch - the Reds were short of attacking invention and strength in the absence of Sadio Mane, who is at the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal.\n\nTheir failure to move the ball quickly enough in the first half meant they did not properly test Swansea's packed defence.\n\nAnd while Firmino scored his first goals in six games - the first a header from Milner's cross, the second a fierce finish after he had chested down Georginio Wijnaldum's delivery - a total of five shots on target and an Adam Lallana deflected effort against the bar is scant product from nearly 75% possession.\n\nWith this result coming after successive away draws at Sunderland and Manchester United, the Reds are in danger of allowing a title challenge to slip away before February has even begun.\n\nTheir next game, at home to the league leaders, is now surely a must win.\n\nWhat the managers said...\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"It's hard to accept. In the first half we created four or five chances which we didn't take.\n\n\"The start of the second half we were poor and then we played brilliantly and scored two. Then we were a bit passive and one player was alone in our box, which is completely senseless.\n\n\"The most disappointing moment was the third goal and I can't explain it as we had so many chances to challenge.\n\n\"It's really difficult to accept at this moment. It is fair Swansea won, no - but was it deserved, yes.\"\n\nSwansea manager Paul Clement: \"We frustrated Liverpool and defended really well. We showed great togetherness and it was a massive team effort.\n\n\"At half-time I told the players we would get at least one chance, but to get three was unbelievable.\n\n\"It's very important for the confidence of the side that we can come to a big team and get a result. We need to work hard on the training pitch and make sure we get another result in 10 days' time.\"\n\nReds first to 50 goals - the stats you need to know\n\u2022 None Liverpool's unbeaten Premier League run at Anfield has ended after 17 matches (11 wins, six draws).\n\u2022 None Firmino has scored three goals in his past two Premier League games against Swansea.\n\u2022 None Llorente has now scored eight Premier League goals but his first two away from home.\n\u2022 None Liverpool conceded three goals at Anfield in a league game for only the second time under Klopp.\n\u2022 None The Reds are the first Premier League team score 50 goals this season, while Swansea are the first to concede 50 (both now on 51).\n\u2022 None Swansea have won back-to-back away league games in the same season for the first time since May 2015.\n\nLiverpool will attempt to overturn a 1-0 deficit when they host Southampton in the EFL Cup semi-final second leg on Wednesday (kick-off 20:00 GMT). The Reds then welcome Wolves to Anfield in the FA Cup fourth round on 28 January (12:30), before another home game - the big one in the Premier League against Chelsea - at 20:00 on 31 January.\n\nSwansea's involvement in the FA Cup ended in the last round so their next game is at home against Southampton in the Premier League on 31 January (19:45).\n\u2022 None Substitution, Swansea City. Jay Fulton replaces Leroy Fer because of an injury.\n\u2022 None Offside, Liverpool. Dejan Lovren tries a through ball, but Divock Origi is caught offside.\n\u2022 None Delay over.
