In fact, she had spent the past 30 years - her whole life - in captivity.\n\nNow she was ill and needed urgent medical attention.\n\nBorn into a \u201ccollective\u201d, she was not allowed to see a doctor, had never been allowed outside alone and had been told that if she tried to leave she would spontaneously combust and die.\n\nWorried she might not survive her illness, on 25 October 2013, Rosie and another woman, Josie, sneaked out.\n\nWaiting for them just round the corner were members of an organisation that helps people who have been abused, trafficked or enslaved. Along with the police, they had helped organise the escape.\n\nIt soon became apparent that Rosie and 57-year-old Josie weren't the only women who lived in the flat, and when police officers returned they met Aisha - a 69-year-old woman originally from Malaysia.

They were terrified of electricity, which they called \u201ceeee\u201d and seemed anxious that household appliances might blow up or explode.\n\nAs they revealed details of their existence and Rosie gradually became more confident, she decided to change her name to Katy, inspired by the lyrics of Katy Perry's song, Roar, which is about a woman overcoming a difficult relationship and finding her voice.\n\nKaty's own story, and everything she had managed to overcome, proved far stranger than anyone could have imagined.",

            "content": "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Could US overseas abortion funding ban lead to more deaths in Africa?\n\nDonald Trump's pro-abortion funding ban has infuriated many global health organisations as they say it will unintentionally lead to more abortions and more deaths in Africa.\n\nThe US president signed the executive order to stop federal money going to international groups which perform or provide information on abortions during his first week in office.\n\nKnown as the \"Mexico City Policy\", or global gag rule by critics, it was no surprise that he reinstated it. First introduced by Ronald Reagan in 1984, it has been become a game of policy ping pong between Republican and Democrat presidents.\n\nSupporters of the ban say it protects the fundamental right to life.\n\nKenyan gynaecologist John Nyamu says the US policy may lead to more backstreet abortions\n\nBut some health workers in Africa say when it was last put in place under George W Bush in 2001, it had far-reaching consequences.\n\n\"Women could not have access to contraceptive services and so they were getting unintended pregnancies and that increased the number of unwanted pregnancies and as such they went to the backstreet to do unsafe abortions,\" says Kenyan gynaecologist Dr John Nyamu.\n\nThe policy blocks US funding to overseas organisations that \"support or participate in the management of a programme of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation\".\n\nIt even affects countries like Kenya - where abortion is illegal unless a mother's life is at risk - as some family planning clinics or organisations get their funding from US pro-abortion groups.\n\nThe Trump order goes even further than previous Republican administrations, which only targeted reproductive health services, by extending the ban to cover all global health assistance provided by all departments or agencies.\n\nRepublican presidents have supported the Mexico City Policy, while Democrats have dropped it\n\n\"By removing funding from organisations that also deal with malaria and other child health issues, the policy could threaten progress on many fronts, including efforts to reduce HIV-related deaths and new infections, and decrease childhood mortality through malaria prevention and treatment initiatives and immunisation programs,\" Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said in a statement.\n\nThe medical charity does not receive US government funding - so is not affected by the policy - but it fears that women's lives could be endangered.\n\nUnsafe abortion is one of the five main causes of maternal mortality, accounting for 13% of cases, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe Mexico City Policy is based on the US Republican party's pro-life position, which has resonance with much of socially conservative Africa, where abortion is largely illegal.\n\nAbortion on demand can only be offered in four out of 54 African countries, according to the UN's World Abortion Policies report.\n\nBut the continent carries the biggest burden of unsafe abortions, according to the WHO.\n\nMarie Stopes International's projections for Nigeria suggest the policy will have a big impact on women's health in Africa's most populous country.\n\n\"Without US funding, from 2017 to 2020, over 1.8 million unintended pregnancies will probably occur; more than 660,000 abortions will happen and over 10,000 maternal deaths will not be averted,\" says Effiom Effiom, country director for Marie Stopes in Nigeria.\n\nMarie Stopes in Nigeria has been receiving funds through USAid\n\nThe International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) regional office in Africa says it will lose up to $100m (\u00a380m) in US funding meant for sexual and reproductive health services for millions of women and girls who would otherwise go without these vital services as it refuses to abide by the gag rules.\n\n\"Over the years USAid has been a huge supporter of family planning - with a budget of over $600m per year. Reinstatement will mean that years of progress to increase access to essential services globally, will be lost,\" it said in a statement.\n\nIPPF works with affiliates in 30 African countries including at least a dozen clinics in Kenya, five of which shut down the last time the Mexico City Policy was reinstated.\n\nBut it has struck a defiant note, saying it will work to bridge the funding and services gaps as the Dutch government has done with plans for an international fund to finance access to birth control in countries hit by the cuts.\n\n\"We cannot and will not - deny life-saving services to the world's poorest women,\" IPPF said.\n\u2022 None What does Trump abortion policy mean?\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Are the traditional red envelope gifts at Chinese New Year being replaced by digital versions?\n\nOver this weekend's Chinese New Year celebrations, millions of people will give each other cash-filled red envelopes, called hongbao in Mandarin.\n\nBut this year, a record number of these red envelopes will be digital and sent online over social messaging services such as Tencent's WeChat, usually via smartphone.\n\nOver the six-day Chinese Spring Festival period last year, 516 million people sent and received 32 billion digital red envelopes - 10 times the number as over the same period in 2015.\n\nAnd this year forecasters are expecting up to 100 billion digital envelopes to be sent and received by Chinese well-wishers around the world.\n\nIt's a vivid illustration of how the world of money is changing, given that we can now send money to each other as easily as sending an email or text.\n\nGlobal research firm Ovum thinks the value of these mobile peer-to-peer (P2P) payments could top $270bn (\u00a3214bn) worldwide in 2019.\n\n2017 is the Chinese Year of the Rooster\n\nSo why is sending money this way proving so popular, particularly among younger people?\n\n\"Social messaging has become the defining app of the smartphone era,\" says Jeremy Allaire, chief executive of P2P payments app, Circle Pay.\n\n\"Social payments has been a natural extension of this phenomenon - it's going to be the locus of most communications activity.\"\n\nPaying somebody by text is quick and easy, removing the hassle of having to go out to a cash machine and hand over money in person. All you usually need is their mobile phone number or email address.\n\nEven if they haven't yet downloaded the app they receive a message telling them money is waiting for them once they've registered.\n\nWhether you're splitting a dinner bill between friends, contributing to shared household costs, or simply sending a gift, payment apps offer convenience within an encrypted, secure environment.\n\nAnd the fact that these payment apps can sit within messaging apps means you can settle bills without even interrupting your group chat.\n\nCircle Pay's Jeremy Allaire thinks social messaging and payments are the future\n\nThe Chinese social media platforms operated by the tech giants Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu have spearheaded the social payments explosion in Asia.\n\nWhile in the US, PayPal-owned Venmo has been growing at a phenomenal pace and looks set to reach about $20bn in annual transaction volume this year. In Africa, M-pesa has blazed a trail and is also now available in India.\n\nFacebook Messenger, which now claims to have more than one billion users globally, has been offering in-app payments since 2015 in the US, but is now poised to expand the service throughout Europe after acquiring the relevant \"e-money\" banking licenses.\n\n\"There's an opportunity to create the WhatsApp of payments and to make this work globally,\" says Mr Allaire, whose payment service is also available within the Apple iMessage app.\n\nHe envisages a world in which there are no barriers to sending money anywhere.\n\nYoung people in particular are happy to use their phones as digital wallets\n\n\"I can send and receive content instantly for free, by text, email and video - so why can't I do the same with money? It's just data and software,\" he says.\n\nCircle's service is built on crypto currency Bitcoin's blockchain system, which enables transactions to be verified and completed quickly and securely, even across borders.\n\nAnd it is this crossborder facility that offers great potential, Mr Allaire believes, largely because banks tend to charge far more than P2P platforms.\n\n\"I can beam money to my kids wherever they happen to be in the world at a cost of 0.3%, whereas banks will typically charge 3%,\" he says.\n\nBut smartphones have been around for nearly a decade, so what has changed to explain this sudden surge in the popularity of social payments?\n\n\"The regulatory environment improved,\" says James Morton, head of UK and Netherlands for Mangopay, a P2P payments platform powering several other apps, such as Pumpkin.\n\nAre we entering the era of low-cost borderless money transfers?\n\n\"To hold client money you have to be regulated, which was a big hurdle to overcome. And the payments infrastructure was quite archaic, working only from bank to bank with a complex structure of issuers, acquirers and processors - it was a very manual process.\"\n\nAllowing firms to become \"e-money issuers\" opened the door to tech companies to automate a lot of these background processes, including the authentication, data protection and money laundering requirements imposed by regulators.\n\nAn international bank-to-bank money transfer can still take days to clear - despite efforts to introduce faster payments - whereas P2P payments can be completed in seconds.\n\nAnd now that younger generations trust the security of their apps and phones - verifying transactions by fingerprint or even facial recognition - P2P service providers are interposing themselves between banks and acting as money repositories themselves.\n\nFor example, Venmo enables its 12 million users to load their Venmo accounts with money and use this fund to pay other people and make in-app purchases.\n\nA Chinese student returning home for the Spring Festival pays her fare using the Alipay app\n\nChinese networks Alipay and WeChat allow users to pay utility bills from their accounts.\n\nThey can also transfer money back to their main bank account within a business day. It's the kind of service PayPal already offers for its customers through its PayPal.me service.\n\n\"If you look at how the gig and sharing economy is growing, I think payments infrastructure will remove the necessity for having your bank debit account for anything other than paying bills,\" says Mr Morton.\n\nNew P2P payment providers have sprung up all over the place: Square Cash, FaceCash Payfriendz, TransferWise, the relaunched Google Wallet, People Pay, Popmoney, Snapcash, Dwolla - the list goes on.\n\nNot that the big banks are twiddling their thumbs while tech upstarts steal their business.\n\nIn the US, a company called Early Warning, which is owned by big names such as Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo, has set up a P2P payments business called ClearXchange with access to more than 100 million customers.\n\nAll you need to send money to someone else's bank account for free is their email address or mobile phone number, much like the UK's PayM system.\n\nCard issuers Visa and Mastercard have joined up with ClearXchange to allow people to make P2P payments via their MasterCard Send and Visa Direct platforms.\n\nThese are exciting times in the world of P2P payments - more competition, more convenience, lower costs.\n\nBut in the Chinese Year of the Rooster, it remains to be seen whether a digital red envelope will bring as much luck and good fortune as the traditional paper one.",

Serena Williams has won the most in the Open era - her victory in the Australian Open taking her to 23.\n\n\"Serena is the greatest of all-time because this era is so much more competitive than previous eras,\" says BBC Sport presenter Sue Barker, herself a former French Open champion.\n\nDo you agree? From our shortlist, pick your 1-7 using our interactive tool - and if you still can't decide, Sue's analysis below might help.\n\nWe will announce your greatest on Monday, 30 January.\n\nPick your greatest champion by ranking the seven women who have won the most Open Era major titles.\n\nBarker: \"Serena has won 23 in an era which is so much more competitive than previous eras. The first, second and third-round matches at Grand Slams are more competitive than they used to be.\n\n\"The pace she generates, her serve is without question the greatest ever, and put that with her movement and her power, she pushes her opponents constantly on the back foot.\"\n\nBarker: \"She is the greatest athlete that has ever played the game. Steffi made everything look effortless and incredibly graceful. The big forehand was her trademark.\n\n\"She was great for the game and we needed someone like her to take the game forward. However, I do feel she was in an era where she was not well challenged because Gabriela Sabatini went away and then so did Monica Seles after her stabbing. We never saw a great rivalry develop.\"\n\nBarker: \"Martina was the first person who changed the physical side of the women's game. While we all just went for a three-mile run, she started doing training off court - she did specific gym exercises and built up muscles which we hadn't seen before. She dominated, and the other players had to change.\n\n\"Her serve-volley was exceptional. I don't think there has been a better serve-volleyer in the women's game at the top level.\"\n\nBarker: \"She was mentally so incredibly hard. To try to get past Chrissie you knew you were going to suffer - you were going to run and run and run. She never broke down, she didn't make an error and played the big points so well.\n\n\"She didn't miss and never got nervous - that's why they called her 'The Ice Princess'. She never look flustered. Mentally she was incredibly strong and solid in every department.\"\n\nMargaret Court - 11 (plus 13 before the Open era)\n\nBarker: \"Margaret was from a very different era. It is difficult to compare because it was a different game then - it wasn't a hard-hitting game. She was tall and had an incredible wingspan, she could almost touch either sideline! She had great reach so just trying to pass her was very difficult.\n\n\"However, most of her Grand Slams were won in Australia - and I sound a little bit disrespectful here - when it was only Australians playing it because no-one went there. I think the records that came later from the others were greater.\"\n\nBarker: \"Monica could have been one of the greatest ever if the stabbing had not happened. She was just beginning to get the better of Steffi.\n\n\"I feel tennis was robbed of that incredible rivalry because she was never the same player when she came back - which was totally understandable.\"\n\nBillie Jean King - 8 (plus four before the Open era)\n\nBarker: \"Billie Jean is the greatest in terms of the whole sport, combining her Slam wins with everything else she has done off the court in terms of promoting the sport.\n\n\"Tennis is probably the best known women's sport because of everything she has done for the game. She was a great champion and moved the game forward.\"",

            "section": "Tyne & Wear",
            "content": "Ida and Louise Cook smuggled valuables out of Germany to help those fleeing the Nazi regime\n\nBetween 1934 and 1939, two \"nervous British spinsters\" were regular visitors to the opera houses of Germany and Austria. But the trips also served a greater and more dangerous purpose - saving Jewish lives.\n\nIda and Louise Cook risked their own lives dozens of times by smuggling out valuable goods for those attempting to flee the Nazi regime, as well as passing on messages and meeting contacts, some of whom were active in the underground movement.\n\nEvery time they left Germany, a border guard could have called into question the ownership of the furs and jewellery they were draped in, putting the sisters in peril of arrest and imprisonment - and worse.\n\nThey met one contact almost under the nose of several high-ranking Nazi officials, when he got in touch with them at their hotel - one of Hitler's lunchtime haunts - asking them to rush outside and jump into his taxi.\n\nThe sisters helped many people to escape, but as Ida said many years later: \"The funny thing is we weren't the James Bond type - we were just respectable Civil Service typists.\"\n\nBy 1934 Germany was under Nazi control\n\nThe Cook sisters were born in the early 1900s, and - in common with a lot of their generation in the wake of the deaths of so many young men during World War One - never married, living quietly at home with their parents in south London.\n\nTheir passion in life was opera, and they became ardent fans - in the words of their nephew John Cook, \"opera groupies\" - attending performances and waiting at stage doors in the hope of getting autographs.\n\nThey also wrote to their favourite opera stars and in 1934 visited the Salzburg Festival, where they were befriended by the conductor and impresario Clemens Krauss.\n\nTheir childhood home in Sunderland has now been marked with a blue plaque\n\nIt was his wife who suggested they \"look after\" a friend who was visiting London and she opened their eyes to the situation Jewish people living in Germany and Austria faced at the time.\n\nSpeaking in a BBC radio interview in 1967, Ida Cook said: \"I can't emphasise sufficiently how we stumbled into this thing.\n\n\"This friend opened our eyes into the appalling situation Jewish people in Germany found themselves in. They were without any rights as human beings at all.\"\n\nThere were restrictions on all aspects of life and although Jews were at this stage able to leave the country, they were unable to take money or possessions with them.\n\nThose wanting to come to Great Britain had to prove they had a job to go to or sufficient funds to live on - the latter presenting huge difficulties due to the money prohibition.\n\nIda and Louise were able to help them get around this Catch-22 situation by smuggling their valuable goods across the border.\n\nThe sisters would arrive in the country plainly dressed without coats, travelling home decked in jewellery and furs, which they pretended were their own.\n\nIda Cook wrote about 130 romances for Mills and Boon under the name of Mary Burchell\n\nThey also persuaded people to vouch for refugees, by offering work or financial guarantees, to satisfy the British requirements for immigration.\n\nSoon the Cook name went around and they began getting \"the most pitiable appeals\" from people wanting to leave.\n\nAt that point Ida - then earning \u00a35 a week as a shorthand typist - wrote what she described as \"a light romance\" which was published by Mills and Boon.\n\nOver the course of the next 50 years, under the pen name of Mary Burchell, she wrote about 130 novels for the publisher and \"the money just kept coming in\".\n\nDuring the late 1930s this funded the sisters' trips to Germany and Austria.\n\nA performance of Richard Strauss's Die Liebe der Danae at the 2016 Salzburg Festival - the Cook sisters attended the event in 1934\n\nWhen their frequent visits aroused suspicion, Krauss, who was then director of the Munich Opera House, stepped in.\n\nHe arranged for performances - sometimes letting them choose which one - in the cities and on the days they requested.\n\nThis allowed them to do their work amid what Ida later described as \"some of the greatest operatic performances of the century\".\n\nThey were careful to arrive and depart via separate border crossings, as it would have given them away if they arrived with very little luggage but left two days later \"loaded to the Plimsoll Line\" with jewellery.\n\nEarrings had to be clip-on ones, as neither had pierced ears, as \"that was the kind of thing officials noticed\".\n\nAnd they had their cover story ready.\n\nIda said: \"Ours was very simple - we were two nervous British spinsters who didn't trust our families at home and so when we went abroad we took all our jewellery with us.\n\n\"There's no answer for that. You can say 'how ridiculous', but you can't say 'it's not true'.\"\n\nClemens Krauss - pictured (left) with German composer Richard Strauss - was instrumental in the sisters becoming involved with the rescues\n\nAnd the danger was very real - they were breaking clearly defined Nazi law.\n\nSunderland historian Stuart Miller said: \"They were smuggling large quantities of valuables knowingly and deliberately and could have been arrested at any point at the border, in which case there was nothing the British government could have done.\n\n\"There are examples of British citizens who were incarcerated and later ended up in concentration camps.\"\n\nHe came across the women's story when Ida's memoir was brought to his attention as he researched local heroes.\n\n\"They left Sunderland early, but they did live there - and it was where Ida was born,\" he said.\n\n\"Children in schools can identify with their story; not only were they local but they were two young women, doing this in a period when women were just coming out of the Victorian and Edwardian age.\n\nAs a permanent reminder of the sisters' heroism, on Friday Sunderland Council unveiled a blue plaque at the entrance of Croft Avenue, which was their childhood home.\n\nJoining local dignitaries for the ceremony, Tony Wortman, chairman of the Newcastle Reform Synagogue, said: \"Ida and Louise Cook saved many Jews... many of whom are still living and now surrounded by their children and grandchildren.\n\n\"For them, life has gone on but this would have not been so had it not been for their bravery and I am pleased to be invited to honour them on behalf of all those they saved.\"\n\nThroughout their lives the sisters rarely mentioned their exploits of the 1930s\n\nIn 1965, the sisters received the Righteous Among the Nations honour from the state of Israel, for their \"warmth of heart, devotion, rare perseverance [and willingness] to sacrifice their personal safety, time and energy\".\n\nIda died in 1986, with Louise outliving her by just over four years.\n\nRemembering the \"quite extraordinary old biddies\", nephew John Cook said: \"They were modest, only mentioned their exploits if asked.\n\n\"They were first really exposed when Ida's wrote her memoirs, which was mostly about operas.\n\n\"The story of the rescues was in the context of opera visits; there was no desire to push them to the forefront.\"\n\nHe added: \"Ida used to say something like: 'You are what you do' and that was about it.\n\n\"They did it because it was the right thing to do, nothing more, nothing less.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "content": "\"It was the unlikeliest of double acts,\" says The Times, as Theresa May and President Trump's face-to-face meeting appears on many front pages. The Daily Mail refers to Donald Trump and Theresa May as \"an odd couple.\"\n\nThe Daily Mirror thinks it was \"like watching Julie Andrews hang out with Hugh Hefner.\" The Sun's cartoonist offers a different comparison with Beauty and the Beast in the Disney version. \"Lady and the Trump\" is the headline in the Daily Star.\n\nThe iconic image is that of the two leaders walking out to face the press \"hand in hand\", says The Daily Telegraph. Daily Mail columnist Quentin Letts thinks that the late Cilla Black would have been encouraged: \"the blind date was a success.\"\n\nThe Guardian, meanwhile, seems stunned by the \"off-the-scale risk\" that Mrs May took. \"Politically,\" it says, the news conference \"was a dash across sniper's alley.\" It adds: \"For Mrs May, the danger was of being collateral damage in a Trump explosion.\"\n\nMost agreed with the view of the Daily Express that she \"managed this tricky task with aplomb.\" The paper writes thinks she has enhanced her standing on both sides of the Atlantic. She has shown, says the Times, \"that engagement beats detachment with the new president in the White House.\" The Sun can't resist offering a formal pat on the back: \"Mission accomplished, Theresa.\"\n\nThe Sun reports that Jeremy Corbyn continued to have what used to be styled \"a little local difficulty\" with his party. \"Whenever you think Labour's chaos cannot get worse, it does.\"\n\nThe Mirror thinks the Labour leader was \"rocked\" by another resignation from his shadow cabinet as more of his MPs refused to support the formal start of Brexit.\n\nThe Express says \"this is terrible conduct on all sides\" and \"it speaks volumes about his incompetence.\" But The i did not think the issue was leaving EU, but \"a question about how to save the party... Should it be a party of unity, or principles?\"\n\nChaos and fiasco: words used by The Times to the long-running problems on Southern Rail. The paper says a trouble-shooter brought in to report on \"Britain's worst performing rail network\" will blame the Department for Transport for \"shoddy management.\"\n\nA source tells the Times that the report is \"dynamite\" and the paper expects there to be more calls for radical action.\n\nWhat do you do with \"the singed fur and charred feet\" of a weasel that lost its life by interrupting the power supply to the Large Hadron Collider, the Guardian asks. The answer is to put it on display.\n\nThe paper reports that the \"fried\" remains of the stone marten are now on show at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam. The director there tells the paper that \"it shows that animal and human life collide more and more, with dramatic results for both.\"",

Millwall host Watford at 12:00 GMT, followed at 16:00 GMT by holders Manchester United against Wigan.\n\nThis was Welbeck's first start since May 2016 but there was not the slightest sign of rustiness as he settled to his task as if he had never been away.\n\nWelbeck's end product has occasionally drawn criticism but it was as smooth as silk here, taking Lucas Perez's pass to loft a clever finish over Southampton's stand-in keeper Harry Lewis for his first, drawing Wenger out of his seat in the stand in delight.\n\nHe was at it again seven minutes later, bringing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's floated pass under his spell before showing composure once more to beat Lewis.\n\nWelbeck then showed his awareness and value as a team player to cross for Walcott to react before any Southampton defender for a simple close-range strike for Arsenal's third.\n\nWelbeck is due a run of good fortune with injuries and he demonstrated here that he brings tireless effort and work-rate to Arsenal's team as well as a goal threat. If he can finally put a run of games together after his long absence, he will be a key asset for Wenger.\n\nWenger wisely withdrew him after 64 minutes with the game safe, to a fully deserved standing ovation from the travelling fans.\n\nThere was a mood of celebration around St Mary's as supporters arrived for this FA Cup fourth-round tie - and rightly so after the outstanding victory over two legs against Liverpool sent them into the EFL Cup final against Manchester United at Wembley on 26 February.\n\nSaints' boss Puel pointed clearly to his priorities with 10 changes from the team that won at Anfield, only defender Jack Stephens keeping his place in the starting line-up.\n\nAnd how it showed as Southampton played like strangers to be ripped apart by Arsenal.\n\nThe party mood was deflated but Saints fans were in forgiving mood, with even the smattering of boos at half-time and at the end sounding very half-hearted, as if this team selection and Anfield hangover was to be expected.\n\nBest seat in the house for Wenger\n\nWenger watched this emphatic Arsenal display from the comfort of a seat in the stand at St Mary's.\n\nHe was serving the first game in a four-match touchline suspension after accepting a Football Association charge of misconduct for verbally abusing and pushing fourth official Anthony Taylor in the win against Burnley at Emirates Stadium.\n\nWenger, who was also fined \u00a325,000, barely had a moment of discomfort as his right-hand man Steve Bould took charge on the touchline.\n\nThere is no doubt the Gunners' boss would have preferred to be in his usual position on the touchline - but he was able to sit back and relax as Arsenal cruised into the FA Cup Fifth round.\n\nA first since Bendtner - the stats\n\u2022 None Theo Walcott scored his fifth Arsenal hat-trick and was the first Arsenal player since Nicklas Bendtner against Leyton Orient in March 2011 to score an FA Cup hat-trick.\n\u2022 None Welbeck scored and assisted in the same game for the first time since September 2014 against Aston Villa.\n\u2022 None Arsenal won an away game by five clear goals for the first time since August 2009 against Everton (6-1).\n\u2022 None The Saints recorded their heaviest home FA Cup defeat since February 1910, when they lost 5-0 to Manchester City.\n\u2022 None This was Southampton's joint-heaviest defeat at the St Mary's Stadium, equalling their 6-1 loss to Liverpool in the League Cup last season.\n\u2022 None Lucas Perez has been involved in eight goals in eight starts for Arsenal in all competitions (five goals, three assists) and assisted Welbeck's first goal in this game.\n\u2022 None Southampton have conceded twice or more in eight of their past nine FA Cup matches against top-flight opponents, doing so in each of their past five.\n\u2022 None Walcott has scored seven goals in his past four away FA Cup matches.\n\u2022 None Alexis Sanchez has had a hand in 11 goals in 10 FA Cup games for Arsenal (five goals, six assists).\n\u2022 None Walcott was the first player to score an FA Cup hat-trick against the Saints since Paul Rideout did so for Tranmere in February 2001, in their famous 4-3 victory.\n\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel: \"I am responsible for the defeat. If I had to do other team at the start I would make the same because it is a difficult moment for us with all these games. We had nine players not available and I had to protect some players. It is not possible to play every three days with the same players and with some players with injuries.\n\n\"It was a good lesson, they are a great team. We started the game without good experience and were nervous. It was better in the final 10 minutes of the first half and in the second half it was interesting - it was a good reaction in the collective.\"\n\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger: \"We were very dynamic, explosive and overall we had a good consistent performance over 90 minutes and everybody played well.\n\n\"Welbeck has been out for such a long time, I didn't expect him to score straight away and it shows the desire is there.\n\n\"People say I make changes but I bring in Walcott, Welbeck and Perez, all top-quality players. After that I try to find the best balance for the team.\"\n\nIt's back to the Premier League on Tuesday as Southampton travel to Swansea looking to record their second successive win in the competition.

This is a story. This is something that I couldn't write a better ending for. This is a great opportunity for us to start our new beginning.\n\n\"It's the one time that I really genuinely feel like no matter what happens, I can't lose, she can't lose. It's going to be a great situation.\"\n\nSerena drew level with Germany's Steffi Graff on 22 Grand Slams when she claimed her seventh Wimbledon title last year, but lost in the US Open semi-finals to Czech Karolina Pliskova.\n\nA seventh title at Melbourne Park would add further credit to her claim as the greatest of all time, despite being one short of Australia's Margaret Court, whose 24 major titles were split between the amateur and professional eras.\n\nVenus failed to reach a single Grand Slam quarter-final between 2011 and 2014 as she battled injuries and Sjogren's syndrome, an auto-immune disease that causes fatigue and joint pain.\n\nNow, however, Venus is enjoying a late resurgence, backing up her run to the last four at Wimbledon six months ago by going one step further here.\n\nSerena would regain the world number one ranking from 2016 champion Angelique Kerber if she wins the title, while Venus would move back into the top 10 if she wins on Saturday.\n\nSerena Williams says that she could not write a better ending to the sisters' remarkable story, but this may not be the final chapter. Venus is the oldest woman in the field, but has proven beyond doubt that she still has the power and the defensive skills to defeat younger challengers.\n\nWhether that includes Serena remains to be seen. The 22-time Grand Slam champion is yet to drop a set in Melbourne: the tougher the opponent, the better she plays. And no-one has more respect for Venus Williams than Serena Williams.\n\n'Serena is super-awesome but I can compete'\n\nVenus, the oldest finalist at Melbourne Park in the Open era, knows her sister doesn't have many weaknesses in her game.\n\n\"When I'm playing on the court with her, I think I'm playing the best competitor in the game. I don't think I'm chump change either, you know,\" she said.\n\n\"I can compete against any odds. No matter what, I get out there and I compete.\n\n\"So it's like two players who really, really can compete, then also they can play tennis.\"\n\n\"OK, it won't be an easy match,\" she added. \"You have to control yourself, then you also have to hopefully put your opponent in a box. This opponent is your sister, and she's super-awesome.\"\n\n*Overall Serena has a 16-11 win-loss record against Venus\n\nFind out how to get into tennis in our special guide.",

            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nWes Morgan salvaged a replay for Leicester City in an FA Cup fourth-round tie with Derby County which will be remembered for a remarkable Darren Bent own goal.\n\nRams striker Bent put the Premier League champions ahead when he scuffed a clearance into his own net while under no pressure trying to clear a corner.\n\nHowever, the former England forward made up for that when he headed Will Hughes' cross into the right net to level the scores.\n\nCraig Bryson put Championship side Derby ahead when he picked the ball up 25 yards out, surged past three Foxes defenders and fired the ball across Kasper Schmeichel with a slight deflection off Robert Huth.\n\nLeicester, who hit the post through Demarai Gray, looked as if they were heading out of the cup before captain Morgan headed home Gray's corner.\n\nDerby had a late penalty appeal turned down when Abdoul Camara's shot hit Huth's hand.\n\nThe replay at the King Power Stadium will be played on Wednesday, 8 February (19:45 GMT).\n\nBent has made a career from close-range tap-ins, but he has never 'scored' one like his opener before.\n\nMarc Albrighton's corner was headed towards goal by Foxes defender Huth. The ball fell to Chris Baird, who tried to control the ball on his thigh but it went away from him back towards team-mate Bent.\n\nThe former Sunderland striker, standing just in front of the line, had plenty of time to control the ball or smash it to safety. But as he swung his foot to clear, the ball hit the side of his boot and flew behind him into the back of the net.\n\nMatch of the Day summariser Graeme Le Saux called it \"just the most bizarre goal\". The former England defender added: \"It is just terrible. From an experienced player, he's got time, he sees the ball. How he fails to get decent contact on it, baffling. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it. He almost kicks it backwards into the net.\"\n\nBBC Radio 5 live's Andy Townsend said: \"He could have taken a touch before clearing. He didn't need to slash at it.\"\n\n\"I don't know what happened,\" said Bent after the game. \"I lost concentration and tried to hit the ball as hard as I could and it flew into the net. It wasn't the greatest start. Fair play to us to stick at it.\"\n\nBent made amends with a goal at the right end when Schmeichel punched a corner to Hughes, whose cross was met by Bent with a glancing header to turn the ball past the keeper into the corner of the net.\n\n\"It was playing on my mind, I thought 'what have I done here'? But I scored at the other end,\" he added.\n\nThe 32-year-old striker has now scored in 10 of his past 11 FA Cup games, including all five for Derby.\n\nThe Foxes rescue a replay they scarcely want\n\nLeicester named a strong team, with nine of their regular starting 11 from last season's title-winning team starting - and a 10th, Riyad Mahrez, coming on midway through the second half.\n\nBut as has been the case for most of their title defence so far - they sit five points above the relegation zone - they looked nothing like the 2015-16 legends.\n\nHowever, they did have enough chances to score before eventually equalising.\n\nHalf-time substitute Gray should have levelled when Albrighton's cross was punched away by Scott Carson to the winger, who fired the rebound straight at the former England keeper.\n\nAnd then moments later, he went even closer when his low shot from the edge of the box hit the post. The ball fell to Shinji Okazaki, whose first effort was blocked and his second - like his team-mate had done a minute before - went straight at Carson, who was on the ground.\n\nAnd, as if to sum up the difference between this season and last, Jamie Vardy - scorer of 24 goals last term and six this time around - headed straight at Carson from about six yards out.\n\nBut Morgan kept them in the cup with his late intervention, albeit in a replay neither side really wanted.\n\nWhile Derby are challenging for the play-offs, Leicester now have to juggle a Premier League relegation battle, a campaign in the Champions League knockout stages and an FA Cup replay.\n\nDerby boss Steve McClaren joked after the game that he would have brought on more strikers at the end to force a winner for either side if he could.\n\nMan of the match - Will Hughes (Derby County)\n\nManager reaction - 'We have to concentrate'\n\nDerby manager Steve McClaren: \"We did everything we could, we came across a team who were at it tonight. Our character was fantastic, we dug in in the second half and Scott Carson made some saves when we needed him to.\n\n\"The penalty incident? It's hit his hand and it's on target. I've seen them given but we didn't get the luck. We fought to the end, neither of us wanted a draw but what a cup tie. It was a great game, great atmosphere and I am proud of the players.\"\n\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"It was a tough match. We started well and scored but slowly we lost our calm. They played well and scored twice. In the second half we again started well and created two or three chances. It was tough to score but thankfully Morgan got one for us.\n\n\"We have to concentrate. Too many times we concede.

This is what happens in our sport occasionally and you've got to face up to it.\"\n\nMany Clouds had started the race at odds of 8-1, with Thistlecrack the 4-9 favourite.\n\nI'm not sure I have ever known the mood on a racetrack change so fast.\n\nOne minute we were hailing a fantastic contest between two fabulous equine athletes, the next word was filtering back that the winner was \"down\".\n\nMemories of the horse needing oxygen and treatment immediately after his Grand National success sparked hopes all would ultimately be well, but then came the announcement over the loudspeaker system.\n\nIt led to stunned silence and tears for a huge favourite who demonstrated himself amongst the most talented steeplechasers of his generation, able to hold his own at the highest level as well as defy a huge weight to win the Grand National.",
