            "section": "Glasgow & West Scotland",
            "content": "The museum appealed for information about the owner of the watch\n\nAn appeal for information about the original owner of a watch gifted to a Scottish museum has helped reunite members of his family.\n\nSidney Worrall was a cook on board the SS Athenia, the first British ship to be sunk by Germany in World War Two.\n\nHe gave his watch to a Canadian passenger and almost 80 years later it ended up at Glasgow's Riverside Museum.\n\nSixteen members of his family responded to the museum curator's plea for more details about Mr Worrall.\n\nThe SS Athenia was a transatlantic passenger liner built in Glasgow which sailed between the UK and Canada.\n\nThe ship was sunk by a torpedo from a German submarine in September 1939, off the coast of Ireland.\n\nMr Worrall was badly injured in the attack, which killed 117 people, and passed his watch to a Canadian man who was in the same lifeboat, Gerry Hutchinson.\n\nWhen Mr Hutchinson died, his son Rob donated the watch to the Riverside Museum.\n\nFamily members Cath Muir and Dr Ernie Worrall were introduced when they viewed the watch at the Riverside Museum\n\nThe Hutchisons believed Mr Worrall had died but the museum later learned he survived his injuries.\n\nHe went on to marry and have a daughter and died in 1973. Family members said he never mentioned the watch he had left in the hands of a stranger.\n\nAmong those to come forward in response to the museum's appeal for information were his granddaughter Cath Muir and nephew Dr Ernie Worrall, who did not know each other.\n\nMs Muir said: \"What a surprise it was when by husband told me there was an appeal for information on my grandfather. I remember him as a child. He was very badly burned when the Athenia was attacked and had many skin grafts on his face and legs. He told us that they were his maps of the world.\n\n\"After returning from Galway he was pensioned out of the Merchant Navy due to the injuries he sustained, but he returned to sea to serve in the war, he felt it was his duty to do so, but that meant he had to forgo part of his pension. After the war he worked as a hospital porter in Law Hospital, Lanarkshire.\n\n\"I am indebted to Gerry for keeping my grandfather's watch safe all these years and I look forward to bringing my own grandchildren to Riverside to see it on display soon.\"\n\nThe seaman's nephew, Dr Worrall, added: \"I was made aware of Riverside's search for my uncle Sid. My father had told me all about him being caught up in the torpedoing of the Athenia.\n\n\"A day or so after the sinking, my grandmother's neighbour was at the cinema and saw on the Pathe newsreel that night my uncle being landed as a survivor in Galway. At the end of the picture show she told my grandmother, who at that point would have been unaware whether her son had been killed or had been rescued.\n\n\"My grandmother hot-footed it down to the cinema just as the manager was closing up for the night and he kindly opened up and re-ran the newsreel for her while she sat in this empty cinema and was able to be reassured that he was indeed alive.\"\n\nHe added: \"Not only has Emily's detective work allowed me to learn more about my family's history, it has put me in touch with Cath and family I didn't know before.\"\n\nRob Hutchinson, who gifted the watch to the Riverside, said: \"I am delighted that the museum has been able to draw together the two ends of this very long story.\n\n\"I look forward to one day seeing the museum's display and possibly meeting Sid's family. My father would have been so pleased.\"\n\nThe watch will go on display as part of an updated SS Athenia exhibition at the Riverside which is expected to open in summer 2017.\n\nCurator Emily Malcolm said: \"It is wonderful to welcome Cath and Ernie to Riverside, to show them Sid's watch and to introduce them to Rob in Canada. I am so pleased they got in touch.\n\n\"We are delighted the family is happy to help Glasgow Museums complete Sid's story and put the watch on display. It's good that something so positive has come from such a disaster.\"",

            "description": "Whether by plan or accident, Donald Trump is undermining the Republican Party's legislative agenda.",
            "section": "US & Canada",
            "content": "With just days to go before inauguration, Donald Trump is making life rather difficult for his party's leadership in Congress.\n\nIt could be by accident. It could be part of a plan to establish his independent credentials. Or it could simply be an early attempt at framing Republican policies in terms palatable to his working-class supporters.\n\nWhatever the reason, Mr Trump has staked out positions that are not exactly in harmony with Republican orthodoxy or the policy direction in which the Republican-led Congress seems to be heading.\n\nOver the weekend Mr Trump told the Washington Post that the goal of his healthcare reform plan, following repeal of the Affordable Care Act, is \"insurance for everybody\".\n\n\"There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it, you don't get it,\" the president-elect said. \"That's not going to happen with us.\"\n\nUniversal coverage is an objective President Barack Obama's healthcare reform sought, but never actually achieved. According to the federal government, even with full implementation of Obamacare and its insurance-coverage mandate, the US uninsured rate was 8.6% in 2016 - albeit a 50-year low.\n\n\"Insurance for everybody,\" outside a single-payer government-provided healthcare plan, is virtually unachievable.\n\nThis is why, when Republican congressional leaders describe their healthcare reform proposals, they generally use the term \"universal access\" not \"universal coverage\".\n\n\"Our goal here is to make sure that everybody can buy coverage or find coverage if they choose to,\" a Republican House of Representatives aide told reporters in December.\n\nDonald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan may not see eye-to-eye on universal healthcare coverage.\n\nThe yet-to-be announced plan congressional Republicans are currently formulating is more likely to be a blend of the measures floated by various conservatives in the past.\n\nFor instance Congressman Tom Price, Mr Trump's nominee to be health and human services secretary, suggested a system that leaned heavily on tax credits and an expansion of existing health-savings accounts, where individuals could put aside untaxed money to pay for future medical needs.\n\nSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan has proposed the creation of federally funded high-risk insurance pools that would enrol individuals who couldn't get insurances elsewhere because of pre-existing medical conditions or other complicating factors.\n\nNone of these would come close to approaching universal coverage or even Mr Obama's uninsured mark over the past few years, however.\n\nAs if that weren't enough, Mr Trump also advocated using the buying power of the federal Medicare prescription-drug programme for the elderly to drive down the cost of pharmaceuticals.\n\nWhile this has long been a goal of Democrats, conservatives have opposed the idea for more than a decade. It's enough to make rank-and-file Republicans reach for their antacids.\n\nLooming over this entire discussion is a Congressional Budget Office report released on Tuesday that predicts a straight-up repeal of Obamacare without any kind of a replacement would result in a doubling of premiums in the individual insurance market by 2026, at which point a total of 32 million Americans would have lost their coverage.\n\nMr Trump, in his comments this weekend, has essentially laid down a marker that repeal will be quickly followed by a replacement that will do a better job advancing Democratic goals of lower drug prices and more universal coverage than the Democrats' own best attempt.\n\nIt is, to put it bluntly, a high bar to reach.\n\nIf reshaping the US healthcare system turns out to be a challenge, at least tax reform was considered a low-hanging fruit for Mr Trump and his party. Even here, however, the president-elect has made comments that undermine Republican efforts to achieve legislative consensus.\n\nA key part of the nascent congressional tax plan involved something called \"border adjustments\", which would tax corporations based on their final point of sale and not on where they are based. This would allow the US to give preference to businesses based in the US - one of Mr Trump's key goals during the campaign. It would also raise enough revenue to allow the overall US tax rate to be lowered from its current 35% mark.\n\nMr Trump, however, said the idea was \"too complicated\".\n\n\"Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don't love it,\" he said. \"Because usually it means we're going to get adjusted into a bad deal.\"\n\nMr Trump appears to support a more direct border tariff, not the more complicated congressional work-around. On Monday he threatened European automakers with a 35% tax on foreign-made vehicles sold in the US.\n\nThe problem this presents for both the president-elect and congressional leaders is it runs directly against his party's long-standing free-trade positions - principles many in Congress have campaigned, and won, on for years. They might be able to dance around the issue with border adjustments and corporate tax reform, but Mr Trump seems more like a bull than a ballerina.\n\nIt's possible to imagine that Mr Trump's recent comments were just, to put it delicately, rhetorical missteps and that he, in fact, is actually on the same wavelength as his Republican colleagues in Congress.\n\nThen again, when pressed by the Washington Post on how he could get his healthcare priorities advanced despite an apparent conflict with current Republican plans, Mr Trump dug in his heels.\n\n\"The Congress can't get cold feet because the people will not let that happen,\" Mr Trump said.\n\n\"I think we will get approval. I won't tell you how, but we will get approval. You see what's happened in the House in recent weeks.\"\n\nThat was an apparent reference to Mr Trump's Twitter-based effort to force House Republicans to back away from a plan to weaken an independent congressional ethics investigation office several weeks ago.\n\nDonald Trump says \"the people\" won't let Congress back away from his ideas\n\nWhether he was directly responsible for causing the legislators to change course or simply reflecting popular outcry is open to debate, but the president-elect seems to be feeling his oats.\n\nAnd if it's this way on tax law and healthcare reform - areas where Republicans and Mr Trump have a fair amount of ideological common ground - imagine what might happen when the president tries to advance his more controversial ideas on immigration or trade. Or pushes his childcare proposal, which met with significant opposition from his party \"allies\" pretty much from the moment he proposed them last October.\n\nAnd what's in store if Mr Ryan goes through with his long-sought dream of entitlement reform - despite Mr Trump's campaign pledges not to touch Medicare or Social Security benefits?\n\nCandidate Trump was a political wild-card, willing to buck conventional wisdom and his own party seemingly on whim.\n\nEarly indications are President Trump could do more of the same. As Republicans celebrate this weekend, storm clouds may be forming on the horizon.",

            "content": "The Syrian army seized East Aleppo from the rebels in December\n\nFor the people who have returned to the ruins of East Aleppo the old phrase \"there's no place like home\" has a whole new meaning.\n\nThe eastern side of Aleppo has been pulverised.\n\nRunning water and mains power are a memory. It is hard to find a building that is not badly damaged. Many look as if they could collapse at any time.\n\nRubble from the buildings that were flattened by artillery fire, barrel bombs or air strikes block many of the streets.\n\nDozens of bulldozers have been working for more than a month to clear a path through the debris.\n\nBut the UN estimates that 40,000 people so far, and more every day, have decided to come back here. They are moving into their old homes or unoccupied buildings that look as if they might do, for a while at least.\n\nAbu Hussein, a man in his 50s, was remarkably cheerful as he stood with his wife Umm Hussein and looked down from their balcony on to the rubble that makes his street impassable for any vehicle.\n\n\"Nothing is better or more beautiful than our home,\" he said. \"It's the place to be in good times or in bad.\"\n\nAbu Hussein and Umm Hussein have returned to a shell of a home\n\nHis family's flat is in Shaar, one of the poorest quarters in East Aleppo. The area is made up mainly of cramped concrete tenements five or six stories high - at least those still standing.\n\nIn Abu Hussein's street, some buildings have collapsed in on themselves.\n\nOthers have had the fronts ripped off, like dolls' houses in a nightmare, exposing beds still made up with sheets and blankets, and sofas teetering close to falling into the street.\n\nThe street where the Husseins live is impassable for any vehicle\n\nAbu Hussein said he was happy because he was home, even though his flat was dark and cold.\n\nHis wife cooks on a small charcoal grill on the stairwell.\n\nThe glass in the windows has gone. It is so well ventilated that the dank mist of a winter's evening seeped in.\n\nHe had spent much of last year with his in-laws, he said, and the sooner they tried to make a go of it back home the better.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAbu Hussein and his wife have a two-year-old son who is still with her parents. They have no jobs, and the small amount of money they had saved went long ago.\n\n\"Of course we have hope,\" Umm Hussein said. \"We'll rebuild and we'll find a solution.\"\n\nThey left East Aleppo two days before the start last year of the major offensive by the Syrian army, backed by Russia and Iran, which by Christmas had beaten the rebels and reunited the city.\n\nDuring the years when the east was isolated, then besieged, it was possible to cross to government-controlled West Aleppo.\n\nAbu Hussein said the trip, which now takes 15 minutes, was possible for anyone who was prepared to take a 17-hour journey through territory controlled by Syria's galaxy of armed groups, including the rebel Free Syrian Army, Kurdish militias, the jihadists of so-called Islamic State, and the armed forces of the Syrian government.\n\nThe United Nations, which spent more than $200m (\u00a3162m) on relief work in Aleppo last year, is particularly concerned that the poor in Shaar have come back out of desperation to a place that is still dangerous.\n\nRelief agencies have put water tanks in the streets. Children struggle through mud and rubble to help their families by carrying water home.\n\nThe east was bombed into submission by Syrian government forces and their Russian backers\n\nAleppo has changed since the government and its allies won the battle for the city last month.\n\nIt no longer feels like a wartime city. Outgoing artillery fire is still a steady drumbeat, aimed at rebel front lines that are not far away.\n\nThe country is at war. But Aleppo's war is over. In the ruins, people are thinking about the future.\n\nSlowly but steadily, some of Syria's millions of displaced people are returning, desperate or optimistic, or both.\n\nAleppo, one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities, was Syria's largest before the war began in 2011\n\nLarge areas of the east side of the city are ghost towns, but there is every chance that more returnees will come back looking for a home once the weather gets warmer in the spring.\n\nThe battle for Aleppo was the most decisive of the war.\n\nIt is a long time since the war was merely a contest between President Bashar al-Assad and armed groups who wanted to destroy the regime.\n\nSo many foreign powers have intervened that this has become an international conflict. Syria has layers of war and not all of them are about the future of the Assad regime.\n\nThe intervention of Russia and Iran tipped the balance in Aleppo. Mr Assad and his allies can, for the first time, smell victory.\n\nForeigners, not Syrians, are setting the pace. And at the moment it looks as if foreign powers will dictate how the war ends.",

He's got a big game, a big serve and takes chances with his forehand.\"\n\nBirmingham's Evans had earlier required the third of three match points to finish off the seventh seed on his own serve.\n\n\"To come through in the last match point was pleasing for me,\" he said.\n\n\"I struggled with the shade on the court and his pace on the ball was coming through pretty quick, but when the sun went down I got into the match.\"\n\nIt is the fourth time Evans has progressed to the last 32 of a Grand Slam - he reached the third round of the US Open in 2013 and 2016, and at Wimbledon in 2016.\n\nHe struggled with an eye problem early in Wednesday's match and lost his composure as Cilic breezed through the first set in 31 minutes.\n\nHowever, the Briton grew more confident, frustrating the 2014 US Open champion and forcing him to make a slew of errors.\n\nThe final two sets were a tussle, with service breaks from both players, but Evans held his nerve to win.\n\nThis was the most impressive scalp of Dan Evans' career - and there is a growing shortlist from which to choose.\n\nThe 26-year-old has reached the third round in each of the last three Grand Slams and is likely to feature in the world's top 50 for the first time as a result.\n\nHe took a while to get used to the power of Cilic's ground strokes but once he had won the second set from a break down, he was simply the best player on the court.\n\nThere was no drama in Andy Murray's rapid victory over Andrey Rublev - until he turned his right ankle in that fall.\n\nAs animated as ever, he told his support team as the match resumed that \"it's not good news\", although he continued to move well and the prognosis seems positive.\n\nWatson and Broady out of doubles\n\nCompatriots Heather Watson and Naomi Broady were knocked out of the women's doubles in the first round, losing 7-5 2-6 7-6 (7-5) to Italy's Karin Knapp and Luxembourg's Mandy Minella.\n\nWatson is in second-round singles action on Thursday against American Jennifer Brady.\n\nBritish number one Johanna Konta takes on Japan's Naomi Osaka at 00:00 GMT, and compatriot Kyle Edmund plays Spain's Pablo Carreno Busta.\n\nLike Konta, world number 46 Edmund is first on court, with Watson to follow at approximately 01:30 GMT.\n\nFind out how to get into tennis in our special guide.",

We thought fitness might tell - with Wimbledon the fitter side - but the one-man advantage was the major factor.\n\n\"It was a great start for Wimbledon, scoring that early goal, then the Robinson sending-off made it difficult for them. I though Sutton played too many high long balls and lacked creativity round the sides.\n\n\"Wimbledon coped with everything until that late, late surge.\"\n\nWhat the managers said:\n\nSutton manager Paul Doswell spoke of his \"unadulterated joy\" as The U's - 15th in the National League - set-up a home tie with Championship Leeds United.\n\n\"I'm so pleased for my chairman, our directors who are all volunteers, for the 1,000 fans here and for the players.\n\n\"Without being over-emotional about it, we have got a good chance against Leeds on our pitch. No one likes playing on it apart from us it seems. If they make seven or eight changes against us I think we will have a chance.\"\n\nDons boss Neal Ardley meanwhile pointed unsurprisingly to the dismissal of Paul Robinson after 15 minutes as the key moment, though he added he had few complaints with the result.\n\n\"You prepare for the game with 11 men but for most of it we had 10,\" he said. \"Credit to Sutton, they kept going and got their just rewards in the end.\n\n\"But we'll never know what would have happened if it was 11 versus 11.

He is a big-hitting player who goes after the shots and plays high-octane tennis.\n\nIt'll be good to see what this young man can bring but it's a very tough ask for someone of that age against Andy.\n\nIt's an environment that Andy really enjoys. You would expect him to get the job done, but he will study him and won't take anything for granted.",

The initial fee was about \u00a325m.\n\nThe deal with PSV is thought to have included a number of add-ons which have not been met.\n\nLyon are fourth in Ligue 1, 11 points behind leaders Monaco and eight points behind PSG in third, the closest Champions League qualification place.\n\nThis season Depay has made eight appearances for United, but has featured for only eight minutes since the end of October.\n\nHowever, United boss Jose Mourinho put that down to the competition for places at Old Trafford.\n\n\"From my perspective, instead of trying to say why it didn't work, I think it is easier for me - and he deserves me to say - that he was a fantastic professional,\" said Mourinho.\n\n\"So if somebody thinks it didn't work because he was not a great professional, it is totally wrong.\n\n\"One thing is some picture that somebody takes with him in an amazing car or dressing in a very specific way, but the image is totally wrong.\n\n\"The guy is a fantastic professional, he is a kid that respected everyone, a kid that tried to work hard to get more chances, a kid that was frustrated because he was not having that, but I only have good things to say about him.\"\n\nHe added: \"If I can find a little reason, it is to say he is a player from one position and the only position where we have overbooking.

            "content": "It's not on a boat, it's not on a plane, it's on a train. The newest way to send your freight from China to Europe involves spending 15 days on a train that doesn't have a buffet car in sight.\n\nOn 3 January in Yiwu in eastern China, a bright orange locomotive pulling 44 containers laden with suitcases, clothes and an assortment of household goods set off on a 7,500-mile (12,000km) journey to western Europe.\n\nTen containers were taken off at the German cargo hub of Duisburg. The rest made up the first cargo train from China to arrive in London at Barking's Eurohub freight terminal.\n\nLondon is the 15th European city to find its way on to the ever-expanding map of destinations for China's rail cargo. Last year, 1,702 freight trains made the voyage to Europe, more than double the 2015 figure.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nYiwu Timex Industrial Investments, which is running this service with China's state-run railways, says prices are half that of air cargo and cut two weeks off the journey time by sea.\n\nThe UK's biggest supermarket, Tesco, doesn't have any goods on this particular train but does use rail to carry toys, electrical goods, homeware and clothing from China to European rail hubs such as Bratislava in Slovakia and Krasnaje in Belarus.\n\nAlistair Lindsay, Tesco's head of global logistics, says the supermarket prefers shipping its goods because this is the most environmentally friendly way, as well as offering the best value for money, but that \"where we need to move products quicker we have that option to do it by rail\".\n\nThis decision would normally be driven by customer demand for particular products, he says.\n\nIt demonstrates how market demand and the realities of globalisation are increasingly allowing China's President Xi Jinping to realise his ambitious plan to revive the ancient Silk Road.\n\nFor centuries the fabled trade route from the ancient capital of Xian provided a link to the bustling markets of European cities such as Istanbul and Venice.\n\nIn the 21st Century China has become the world's biggest exporter, with the export of goods totalling $2.28 trillion (\u00a31.85tn) in 2015.\n\nThe Silk Road provided a link to the markets of European cities like Istanbul and Venice\n\nThis rail expansion is part of President Xi's \"One Belt, One Road\" (OBOR) trade policy. For Beijing it offers another way to sustain its economic growth.\n\nKazakhstan is one of the countries on the route and it was there that Mr Xi first outlined his vision in a speech in 2013 saying, \"This will be a great undertaking benefiting the people of all countries along the route.\"\n\nExtolling the virtues of globalisation was a theme he repeated again at Davos this week.\n\nFor some, this is as much political as economic, offering Beijing the chance to project soft power as well as demonstrating it has the influence to thread disparate nations from Russia to Spain together.\n\nChina is also pushing its version of a \"maritime silk road for example\", by building a $1.4bn port city in Sri Lanka\n\n\"[OBOR] is set to become Xi Jinping's grand legacy,\" says Dr Sam Beatson, of King's College London.\n\n\"Regardless of the returns on offer... the policies will continue to be pushed as a means of seeking to fulfil Xi's dream under his leadership.\"\n\nOne of the other legacies President Xi is trying to tackle is China's pollution problem. While rail cargo is not as green as sea transport it emits less carbon dioxide (CO2) than air travel.\n\nFreight transport accounts for about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions\n\nThis is the \"first argument when trying to get our customers to re-evaluate their options\", says Johan Ignell, rail freight manager at Swedish cargo firm Greencarrier.\n\nIt calculates that a 40ft (12m) container with 20 tonnes of cargo would account for just 4% of the CO2 emissions it would take to move it by air (though emissions would be more than halved again if it were moved by sea).\n\nFreight transport accounts for about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but it is \"fraught with difficulty\" to compare emissions from different transport modes, says Prof Alan McKinnon of Germany's Kuehne Logistics University.\n\nProf McKinnon, one of the authors of a 2014 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), says \"load factor, energy efficiency and power sources all make a difference and can be hard to ascertain\".\n\nChina is now the world's biggest exporter\n\nHe adds: \"While shifting air cargo to rail will certainly cut emissions, container shipping will continue to command a significant carbon advantage over transcontinental rail, particularly now that most vessels are slow steaming to save fuel.\"\n\nThere is also a business case for this emerging trade route to grow. Not least among European companies looking to export to China.\n\nAt the moment there are no plans to run a return train service from London but that could change quickly. China is already the European Union's second biggest export market - though there is an EU trade deficit in goods of about $190bn.\n\nFor UK companies facing up to the reality of Brexit, China is an attractive proposition and the train carries new opportunities.\n\nBrand Avenue is a company that already exports British-made goods including cosmetics and jewellery to China, and chief executive Jody Jacobs says he's exploring moving to rail.\n\n\"We deal a lot in goods which weigh a lot in comparison to their volume [which is] where airfreight becomes expensive, such as cosmetics and baby food.\n\n\"So for us a service which is quicker than sea and cheaper than air is a great middle ground.\"\n\nFor UK companies facing up to the reality of Brexit, China is an attractive proposition\n\nFor established cargo companies rail also offers the potential for growth. Shipping lines have seen profits fall because of overcapacity attributed to the aftermath of the global financial crisis.\n\nThe world's biggest shipping company, Maersk, told the BBC it is investigating \"possible opportunities\" in long-distance rail, though it sees them as supplementary to sea and air routes.\n\nChina is planning another 20 European routes for rail freight, and with the world's demand for consumer goods continuing to grow, all the ingredients seem to be there for rail to help the global economy steam ahead in 2017 and beyond.",

Instead she is hoping to conclude a deal with the rest of the EU that will still give business the access it needs to trade with the rest of the continent without barriers, tariffs or any new obstacles.\n\nSince the referendum she and her ministers have simply refused to be so explicit. Some Remainers have argued that she ought to try to keep us in the vast partnership, the risks to the economy are too vast, and while it might be complicated to achieve, the prize is simply too great to give up.\n\nFor months some ministers have privately whispered about complex solutions that might keep elements of membership, the choices not being binary, mechanisms that might give a sort of membership with a different name.\n\nWell no more, the simple and clear message from Theresa May's speech is that we are out. The irony that she has delivered that vow on the same spot where her predecessor swore the transformative value of the single market hangs alongside the glittering chandeliers",

            "section": "UK Politics",
            "content": "Basil Fawlty discovered that some subjects were taboo\n\nLike some latter-day Basil Fawlty, Boris Johnson mentioned the War and didn't get away with it.\n\nThe foreign secretary urged the French president not to \"administer punishment beatings\" on Britain for choosing to escape the EU \"rather in the manner of some World War Two movie\".\n\nNot surprisingly, uproar has ensued. Former Labour leader Ed Miliband said Mr Johnson had shown once again that he could be \"supremely clever and yet immensely stupid\".\n\nTo some Britons, Mr Johnson's remarks will be seen as colourful but unexceptional language that echoes the popular World War Two film The Great Escape.\n\nTo many of Mr Johnson's generation, these films were part of their childhood and are subject to frequent cultural reference. Former Prime Minister David Cameron has seen The Guns of Navarone more than 17 times and once quoted a line from the film in a party conference speech.\n\nI know one former Conservative cabinet minister who can quote reams from Where Eagles Dare. (Full disclosure, so can I).\n\nYet this hinterland of war films from the 1960s and 1970s, seen by some today as jingoistic, can create a tin ear among some Britons when it comes to recognising how sensitive many Europeans remain towards this period in their history.\n\nThe foreign secretary has form on this. During the referendum campaign last year he compared the EU to Nazi Germany, telling the Daily Telegraph both were attempting to unify Europe: \"Napoleon, Hitler, various people tried this out, and it ends tragically.\"\n\nThis caused a flurry of headlines and a social media storm that passed quickly. Yet the impact on EU politicians was lasting.\n\nOne EU diplomat explained it to me like this: \"You Brits don't understand us when we talk about European values. To us they are important because they are not Nazi values, they are not Vichy values, they are not fascist values, not the values of the Greek junta. They are the values of a different Europe.\n\n\"So for that clown to compare us to the Nazis, well, that hurts and will not be forgotten.\"\n\nIn other words, the global conflict from which the EU's forerunner emerged - and was ultimately designed to prevent recurring - lingers long in the mind on the continent.\n\nSo perhaps the foreign secretary might take the advice of Gisela Stuart, the German-born Labour MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, who said she was sure her fellow Brexit campaigner did not mean to be offensive but added: \"For the next two years\u2026 just don't mention the war.\"\n\nOr maybe Mr Johnson might remember the last line of the Fawlty Towers episode when a ranting Basil is being led away by the nurses and one of the stunned German guests asks: \"However did they win?\"",

            "section": "US & Canada",
            "content": "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. What was Melania Trump like in Slovenia?\n\nThe President Burger is presented with a flourish - on a wooden board, surrounded by circular \"dollar fries\" and topped with a yellow crust of cheese \"hair\" which looks as if it might fly away at any moment.\n\nAs tributes to the US President-elect go, it may not be the most respectful. But it is offered with the affection and gentle humour which it soon becomes apparent is a hallmark of Sevnica, a Slovenian town which just happens to be the place where Donald Trump's first-lady-to-be, Melania, spent most of her childhood.\n\n\"We formed the burger so it would resemble Trump a little bit,\" chuckles Bruno Vidmar, the chef-proprietor of Rondo, a restaurant in the newer part of Sevnica.\n\n\"It has hot peppers, because Trump's statements are hot - and it comes with dollar fries because he's a successful entrepreneur.\"\n\nThe owner of the Rondo restaurant designed this burger to resemble Donald Trump\n\nThe presidential tie-in seems to be serving Rondo well: on a weekday morning, the place is buzzing with an early lunch crowd from the nearby furniture and textile factories. Meanwhile a table full of smartly-dressed young women order another of Bruno's culinary creations dreamt up with Sevnica's most famous daughter in mind.\n\n\"The 'Melanija' dessert is made out of sponge, then there's a layer of mascarpone and strawberries. It's light enough for a model - and we have it on good authority that Melania loves strawberries.\"\n\nSevnica is a small place - so Bruno probably did not have to search long to find an authority on what Melania likes for pudding. Or, at least, what she did like when she was growing up as Melanija Knavs in this town of fewer than 5,000 people.\n\nBar the addition of a branch of Lidl on the outskirts, little seems to have changed since she left for Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana, as a teenager. The old castle - parts of which date back to the 12th Century - still overlooks Sevnica from its hilltop perch.\n\nThe town itself is a tidy place with new and old sections, sitting alongside the River Sava and surrounded by forested hills. The Slovenian Tourist Board suggests that Sevnica is \"an excellent destination for those who enjoy picnics and outings, hiking, cycling or fishing\".\n\nIf the roads had been less icy, it would certainly have been an enjoyable ride through the trees to Gosti\u0161\u010de Ob Ribniku, a restaurant and guesthouse next to a small lake. Inside the traditional wooden chalet, you can chat to one of the people who can shed some light on the future first lady's early years.\n\nSevnica is \"an excellent destination for those who enjoy picnics and outings, hiking, cycling or fishing\" according to the Slovenian Tourist Board\n\n\"We were next door neighbours - and we used to go the same way to school,\" says Mateja Zalezina, who runs Gosti\u0161\u010de Ob Ribniku with her husband, Dejan.\n\n\"In the afternoon when we came back we used to hang out in front of the apartment block. Even then she was quite busy, because her mother was a fashion designer and Melania was one of the models for the Jutranjka company that did fashion for kids.\"\n\nMateja laughs at the idea that she could have spotted that her neighbour would go a long way from Sevnica - never mind all the way to the White House. But she says that Melania could not help but stand out.\n\n\"She was really good at school. She and her sister Ines were studying really hard. After school, we played a game called 'gumi-twist', an elastic band game, and she was really good at that. She had the figure of a model - really long legs - and she always won!\"\n\nThe restaurant is offering a three-course \"Melanija Menu\" in honour of Mateja's former playmate. But, like Rondo's eponymous offering, this does not feel like a culinary cash-in, just a low-key tribute, delivered with affection.\n\n\"I'm really happy for her - she's achieved the maximum,\" says Dejan. \"I hope everyone in Sevnica will watch the inauguration. We will be here at the restaurant with friends and will raise a glass to them both.\"\n\nMelania's former neighbour says America's next first lady studied \"really hard\" at school\n\nBack in the old town, beneath the castle, Sevnica's mayor Srecko Ocvirk is not planning any special events to mark the start of the Trump era. But he hopes the publicity will bring the town's charms to the attention of tourists.\n\n\"The first visitors who came were journalists like you,\" he admits. \"But we're now seeing there are rising numbers of tourists. We're also expecting more organised tour groups after the inauguration. Sevnica and the region will become better known because of this.\"\n\nAt the town's primary school, one of the staff has certainly achieved a degree of local celebrity. Art teacher Nena Bedek was best friends with Melania until the future Mrs Trump left to finish her schooling in Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana.\n\nNow Nena fields questions from her students about her friendship with Sevnica's most famous former resident - and marvels at the different paths their lives have taken.\n\n\"It's a 'wow' effect for us and for me,\" she says.\n\n\"She was a reliable girl and a very good friend. But she never wished to stand out - even though she was beautiful and hard-working. She loved to read and draw. She was brought up in a very artistic manner - she knew what was beautiful - due to her mother's job as a fashion designer. I have very fond memories and keep her very close in my heart.\"\n\nAs for the town's various tributes - which include wine, slippers and honey as well as the culinary offerings - Nena believes they are in keeping with the Sevnica spirit.\n\n\"They are very sympathetic and sweet - none of them are bad things - and it's also funny. I think it's still within limits - all in all it's sweet and nice.\"\n\nRather like Sevnica itself, perhaps.\n\nYou can hear Guy De Launey's report from BBC Radio 4's World Tonight via BBC iPlayer.",

            "description": "Could a club for \"girly girls\" really help improve female equality in the workplace?",
            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Shelley Zalis says \"trying to be a man is a waste of a woman\"\n\n\"Embrace your inner girl\" is not a phrase you'll hear very often, particularly in the macho world of business where \"manning up\" is more de rigueur.\n\nYet if you attend any major business conference this year, then you're likely to come across \"The Girls' Lounge\".\n\nIt might sound like a name dreamt up by an unimaginative spa owner or an all-female pop-band, but in reality it's a professional networking space for women.\n\nOn the eve of the World Economic Forum in Davos - a place where male attendees outnumber females five to one, the space is just being prepared.\n\nA peek through the windows show that it's all white sofas and cushions, some adorned with glitter pink writing. The decor is soft and unashamedly feminine.\n\nLounges at previous conferences have included beauty treatments, such as face masks and manicures.\n\nAside from the patronising use of the word \"girl\", surely the idea that women need a separate mingling space, and such a stereotypically feminine one to boot, is doing little to further the case for female equality?\n\nShelley Zalis - who started The Girls' Lounge five years ago - is unapologetic:\n\n\"This is their boys' club - for women to get to know other women.\n\n\"There are masculine and feminine styles of leadership and we encourage women to find and lead with their strengths. We need both [styles] or we're all the same,\" she says.\n\nMs Zalis resolutely refuses to apologise for using the word \"girl\", arguing the word \"woman\" is too associated with the traditional hierarchy where female leaders conform to male leadership styles.\n\nBeyond Ms Zalis' deliberately provocative and attention-grabbing approach, her point is that women need to take on leadership in whichever way they choose, not emulating the male, institutional model.\n\n\"We have to stop fixing the women. We have to fix our mindset and recalibrate our mindset on equality and understand men and women are all equal. Until society and corporations value the individual strengths of each person we won't progress,\" she says.\n\nAnd in The Girls' Lounge, underneath the seemingly fluffy interior, there's plenty of hard facts.\n\nIn it, for example, there are ten clocks from various countries. Based on a nine to five day, they point to the time a woman should leave work according to the wage gap in the country.\n\nAt the World Economic Forum in Davos, male attendees outnumber female by five to one\n\nThe US clock points to 3.20pm, highlighting the fact that women there earn only 79% of what men earn.\n\nTo make the same point, men in the Girls' Lounge are charged $1 for a bar of chocolate, while women pay 79 cents.\n\nWhile Ms Zalis' initial aim was simply to provide a space for women to feel less isolated at male dominated business events, the Girls' Lounge now hosts serious talks on addressing inequality and has attracted some heavyweight commercial partners including Unilever and Google.\n\nThe Girls' Lounge is part of The Female Quotient, the firm founded by Ms Zalis which aims to advance workplace equality.\n\nThe firm has conducted research for consumer goods giant Unilever showing the extent to which underlying bias is holding back progress on the issue.\n\nThe study, published on Tuesday, showed that not only do an overwhelming 77% of men believe that a man is the best choice to lead an important project, but also the majority (55%) of women.\n\nMore so, men and women overwhelmingly believe that men don't want women in top corporate positions, according to the research, which interviewed more than 9,000 men and women across eight markets.\n\nUnilever changed its adverts last year to make them less gender stereo-typed\n\nUnilever's chief marketing officer Keith Weed said the poll pinpointed how traditional beliefs and norms were still holding back women's progress.\n\n\"Men have intellectually bought into [the] whole area of gender inequality, but acting on it there's still a long way to go. We are holding stereotypes in our head that we fit people into,\" he said.\n\nMr Weed said addressing the issue was not just \"a moral issue but an economic issue\".\n\nThe firm, behind more than 400 brands from Ben & Jerry's ice-cream to Dove soap, last year pledged to remove sexist stereotypes from its own ads.\n\nMr Weed said while it was too early to measure the impact of this change, its previous research had shown that progressive ads were 12% more effective.\n\nErica Dhawan is optimistic about the future of gender equality\n\nYet, Erica Dhawan, a female chief executive of consultancy Cotential, perhaps offers some hope.\n\nIn her thirties, she says she identifies herself as part of several groups: a millennial, an Indian American, and has never thought there's anything that either women or men could do better.\n\n\"We can't solve age old problems with old solutions. We need to redefine inclusion in today's modern world and by bringing new perspectives we can improve gender equality. I'm extremely optimistic I believe we need to broaden the conversation.\n\nMs Zalis also believes the new corporations which have emerged in the past couple of decades, such as the tech giants such as Facebook and Google, could help to adjust the balance.\n\n\"Most traditional corporations were founded over 100 years ago when women weren't in the workplace. Newer firms have equality in their DNA,\" she says.\n\nHopefully that heralds a future where there will be no need for a girls or boys club but just clubs.",

I first met him when we played a Davis Cup tie probably nine, 10 years ago. You spend a week together in the build-up and since then I've seen him a lot at various events.\n\nHe used to have a reputation of maybe not working that hard but every time I have been on the court with him, he has been fantastic.\n\nHe's a natural competitor. Once you get him on the match court, he always tries his best and gives his best effort and I really respect that.\n\nAway from the court, he's a pretty relaxed guy. He doesn't take himself too seriously and he likes to have a good time, but when he's playing, he's focused. He's a very talented player.\n\nI haven't spoken to him loads about his tennis. He has a team around him that is doing such a fantastic job.\n\nIf he keeps doing what he's doing, who knows where he could end up? It's exciting to see how good he is going to be. We still don't know what his limit is.\n\n'We want to inspire kids to pick up a racquet'\n\nIt's a really promising time to be part of British tennis. A number of players are close to the top of their game and that's really good.\n\nI definitely think that having a number of different players, with different personalities and backgrounds and playing styles, is really positive. I hope it keeps going that way.\n\nA lot of kids might watch tennis and hate watching me. But some might love watching Johanna Konta, or Dan, or Kyle Edmund or Heather Watson.\n\nThe more choice there is, the more role models people have to look up to and that is a really positive thing.\n\n'I was worried about my ankle'\n\nThere was a moment of panic when I went over on my ankle during my match against Andrey Rublev. You don't know how bad it is until you get up and you're also a bit shocked about going over.\n\nOnce I got up and started moving around, it was still a bit concerning because it was sore. I'm walking around on it fine now - it's sore, but it's OK.\n\nFor now, it's all about icing it and keeping it elevated. I had an ice bath after the game and I'll be keeping it cool for the next few days. It's all good.\n\nFacing Rublev did give me a few flashbacks to when I was first starting out.\n\nI played Rafael Nadal when I was 19 at the 2007 Australian Open. Going out for the first time against one of the top players does influence the way you play.\n\nI expected Rublev to come out going for his shots, because he had nothing to lose. He got off to a pretty quick start but once I settled down, I played some good stuff. He's a good player though and definitely one to watch in the future.",

My interview with him in Moscow did not end well.\n\nDugin posted a critical blog entry after walking out of his interview with John Sweeney\n\nFirst, he dismissed the chances that the Russians hacked American democracy as \"strictly zero\".\n\nI asked him about the depth of Mr Putin's commitment to democracy.\n\n\"Please be careful,\" he responded. \"You could not teach us democracy because you try to impose to every people, every state, every society, their Western, American or so-called American system of values without asking\u2026and it is absolutely racist; you are racist.\"\n\nToo many of Mr Putin's critics end up dead - around 20 since he took power in 2000.\n\nI have met and admired three: Anna Politkovskaya, Natasha Estemirova and Boris Nemtsov.\n\nBoris Nemtsov was murdered close to the Kremlin in 2015\n\nMr Nemtsov was shot just outside the Kremlin's walls.\n\nI asked Mr Dugin what his death told us about Russian democracy.\n\n\"If you are engaged in Wikileaks you can be murdered,\" he countered.\n\nI then invited Mr Dugin to list the American journalists who have died under Barack Obama.\n\nMr Dugin did not oblige but told me that ours was a \"completely stupid kind of conversation\" and walked out of the interview.\n\nLater, he posted a blog to his 20,000 followers, illustrated with my photograph and accusing me of manufacturing \"fake news\" and calling me \"an utter cretin... a globalist swine\".\n\nSuch is the language of the new world order.\n\nA few days later I watched the press conference when Mr Trump closed down a question from a CNN reporter by accusing him of manufacturing \"fake news\".\n\nUnder Trumputinism, the echo between Russia and America is getting louder by the day.\n\nPanorama: The Kremlin Candidate?

            "content": "Theresa May set out her Brexit strategy in a speech in London\n\nTheresa May's Brexit speech is pretty much the only story in town, at least as far as the front pages are concerned.\n\nIt is the tough rhetoric which captures the headlines.\n\nThe Times headline sums up her message to the EU as \"Give us a fair deal or you'll be crushed\".\n\nAt the opposite end of the market, the Daily Star renders it as \"May: I will crush EU\".\n\nFor the Daily Mail, the parallels with Margaret Thatcher are hard to resist. It says the speech showed the \"steel of the new Iron Lady\".\n\nAmong the papers that opposed Brexit, the Guardian found the speech a \"doubly depressing event\" - a reality check for those who want to keep the UK in the single market while being riddled with its own streak of \"global fantasy\".\n\nBut the Guardian acknowledges that as a political manoeuvre it was a huge success for Mrs May and has strengthened her authority.\n\nThe Financial Times praises the prime minister's \"bold vision\" but warns that the road ahead will be perilous.\n\nThe Daily Mirror says Brexit will be a rollercoaster ride and only the reckless would pretend that it will be easy to reach a good deal with other nations.\n\nThe Sun's front page is mocked up as a Biblical tablet of stone with the single word headline \"Brexodus\".\n\nThe paper says Mrs May could call a snap election if Parliament votes to reject the deal she negotiates.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph praises the \"steel behind\" Mrs May's words and declares the speech \"a defining moment in British politics\".\n\nMatt's cartoon has a worker bricking up the Channel Tunnel and remarking: \"Mrs May's Brexit is a little harder than we'd been led to expect\".\n\nIn other stories, the recently-retired head of the Serpentine Gallery in London, Dame Julia Peyton-Jones, features widely after becoming a mother at the age of 64.\n\nThe Daily Mail says that instead of putting her feet up after a high-flying career, the woman known as the \"Queen Of Arts\" will now be busy raising her daughter, Pia.\n\nDame Julia has not revealed further details, and the papers cannot say whether she had the child naturally or through a surrogate mother, IVF or adoption.\n\nThe Times reports that Manchester United, the world's richest football club according to Forbes magazine, has defended the launch of three new replica kits each season by claiming that their fans want \"newness\".\n\nThe paper thinks that argument flies in the face of concern expressed by parents at the high cost of funding their children's support for top teams.\n\nEach new United kit costs \u00a388 pounds for a child's version. Manchester City, Spurs and Arsenal also bring out three new strips per season.\n\nFinally, the Daily Telegraph reports that intelligence agency GCHQ is launching a recruitment drive targeting teenage girls who know their way around social media.\n\nA nationwide competition will launch next month designed to attract thousands of potential female spies with the skills to protect the nation against cyber attacks.\n\nThe Telegraph says the security services want to tackle their image as \"male, pale and stale\" by recruiting more \"Jane Bonds\" to their ranks.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Trade makes the world go round, but how free can it remain?\n\nFree trade is something of a sacred cow in the economics profession.\n\nMoving towards it, rather slowly, has also been one of the dominant features of the post-World War Two global economy.\n\nNow there are new challenges to that development.\n\nThe UK is leaving the European Union and the single market - though in her speech this week, British Prime Minister Theresa May promised to push for the \"freest possible trade\" with European countries and to sign new deals with others around the world.\n\nMost obviously Donald Trump has raised the possibility of quitting various trade agreements, notably Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. Even the World Trade Organization (WTO) has proposed new barriers to imports.\n\nIn Europe, trade negotiations with the United States and Canada have run into difficulty, reflecting public concerns about the impact on jobs, the environment and consumer protection.\n\nThe WTO's Doha Round of global trade liberalisation talks has run aground.\n\nThe World Trade Organization is based in Geneva and came into being in 1995\n\nThe case for trade without government imposed barriers has a long history in economics.\n\nAdam Smith, the 18th Century Scottish economist who many see as the founding father of the subject, was in favour of it. But it was a later British writer, David Ricardo in the 19th Century, who set out the idea known as comparative advantage that underpins much of the argument for freer trade.\n\nIt is not about countries being able to produce more cheaply or efficiently than others. You can have a comparative advantage in making something even if you are less efficient than your trade partner.\n\nWhen a country shifts resources to produce more of one good there is what economists call an \"opportunity cost\" in terms of how much less of something else you can make. You have a comparative advantage in making a product if the cost in that sense is less than it is in another country.\n\nEconomic arguments over free trade date back to the 19th Century\n\nIf two countries trade on this basis, concentrating on goods where they have a comparative advantage they can both end up better off.\n\nAnother reason that economists tend to look askance at trade restrictions comes from an analysis of the impact if governments do put up barriers - in particular tariffs or taxes - on imports.\n\nThere are gains of course. The firms and workers who are protected can sell more of their goods in the home market. But consumers lose out by paying a higher price - and consumers in this case can mean businesses, if they buy the protected goods as components or raw materials.\n\nThe textbook analysis says that those losses add up to more than the total gains. So you get the textbook conclusion that it's best to avoid protection.\n\nMany lower-skilled workers in developed economies feel they have lost out in the drive to globalisation\n\nAnd this conclusion is regardless of what other countries do. The 19th Century French economist Frederic Bastiat set it out it like this:\n\n\"It makes no more sense to be protectionist because other countries have tariffs than it would to block up our harbours because other countries have rocky coasts.\"\n\nThe implication is that unilateral trade liberalisation makes perfect sense.\n\nA more recent theory of what drives international trade looks at what are called economies of scale - where the more a firm produces of some good, the lower cost of each unit.\n\nThe associated specialisation can make it beneficial for economies that are otherwise very similar to trade with one another. This area is known as new trade theory and the Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman was an important figure in developing it.\n\nThe basic idea that it's good to have freer trade has underpinned decades of international co-operation on trade policy since World War Two.\n\nFree trade has been a cornerstone of the post-war world\n\nThe period since 1945 has been characterised by a gradual lowering of trade barriers. It happened in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which began life in 1948 as a forum for governments to negotiate lower tariffs.\n\nIts membership was initially small, but by the time it was replaced by the World Trade Organization in 1995, most countries had signed up.\n\nThe motivation was to end or reduce the protectionism or barriers to trade that went up in the 1930s. It is not generally thought that those barriers caused the Great Depression, but many do think they aggravated and prolonged it.\n\nThe process of post-war trade liberalisation was driven largely by a desire for reciprocal concessions - better access to others' markets in return for opening your own.\n\nBut what is the case against free (or at least freer) trade?\n\nFirst and foremost is the argument that it creates losers as well as winners.\n\nWhat Ricardo's theory suggested was that all countries engaging in trade could be better off. But his idea could not address the question of whether trade could create losers as well as winners within countries.\n\nEconomic theory says if governments adopt protectionism, total losses will outweigh total gains\n\nWork by two Swedish Nobel Prize winners, Eli Hecksher and Bertil Ohlin, subsequently built on by the American Paul Samuelson developed the basic idea of comparative advantage in a way that showed that trade could lead to some groups losing out.\n\nPutting it very briefly, if a country has a relatively abundant supply of, for example, low-skilled labour, those workers will gain while their low-skilled counterparts in countries where it is less abundant will lose.\n\nThere has been a debate about whether this approach fits the facts, but some do see it as a useful explanation of how American industrial workers (for example) have been adversely affected by the rise of competition from countries such as China.\n\nA group of economists including David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology looked at the impact on areas where local industry was exposed to what they call the China shock.\n\n\"Adjustment in local labour markets is remarkably slow, with wages and labour-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated for at least a full decade after the China trade shock commences.\n\nAt this week's World Economic Forum, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned against isolationist moves that could spark a trade war\n\nStill if you accept that overall countries gain, then the winners could in principle fully compensate the losers and still be better off.\n\nSuch programmes do exist. Countries that have unemployment benefits provide assistance to people who have lost their jobs. Some of those people will have been affected by competition from abroad.\n\nThe United States has a programme that is specially targeted for people who lose their jobs as a result of imports, called Trade Adjustment Assistance.\n\nBut is it enough? Lawrence Mishel of the Economic Policy Institute, a think-tank in Washington writes: \"The winners have never tried to fully compensate the losers, so let's stop claiming that trade benefits us all.\"\n\nWhich arguments will Donald Trump be listening to in the White House?\n\nIn any case, it is not clear that compensation would do the trick. As Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor noted, they may lose their jobs and also \"the dignity of work\".\n\nHe is keen on maintaining open markets for trade, but recognises the need to do something about what you might call the side effects.\n\nTo return to recent political developments - Donald Trump clearly did get support from many of those people in areas of the US where industry has declined.\n\nWe don't yet know how he will address those issues when he takes his place in the White House.\n\nPerhaps his threats to introduce new tariffs are just that - threats. But the post-war trend towards more liberalised international trade looks more uncertain than it has for many years.",

            "section": "US & Canada",
            "content": "On 20 January, inauguration day in the United States, a nameless, unknown military aide was seen accompanying President Barack Obama to the handover ceremony at the US Capitol in Washington.\n\nThat military aide was carrying a satchel over his or her shoulder containing a briefcase known as \"the nuclear football\". Inside was a piece of digital hardware measuring 3in (7.3cm) by 5in, known as \"the biscuit\".\n\nThis contained the launch codes for a strategic nuclear strike. The briefing for the incoming president on how to activate them had already taken place out of public sight, but the moment President-elect Donald Trump took the oath of office that aide, and the satchel, moved quietly over to his side.\n\nFrom then on, Donald Trump has had sole authority to order an action that could result in the deaths of millions of people in under an hour. The question on a lot of people's minds is, given his thin skin and impulsive temperament, what are the safeguards, if any, to prevent an impetuous decision by one man with catastrophic consequences?\n\nFirst off, it should be said that Donald Trump has previously rowed back on some of his earlier, provocative comments on the use of nuclear weapons. He stated he would be \"the last person to use them\", although he did not rule it out.\n\nOther senior figures are also involved in the chain of command, such as the US Secretary of Defence, retired US Marine Gen James Mattis, But Mark Fitzpatrick, a nuclear non-proliferation expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Washington, says that ultimately, the sole authority to launch a strike rests with the president.\n\n\"There are no checks and balances on the president's authority to launch a nuclear strike,\" he says. \"But between the time he authorises one and the time it's carried out there are other people involved.\"\n\nThe idea of a rogue president taking such a monumental decision on his own is unrealistic. He gives the order and the secretary of defence is constitutionally obliged to carry it out.\n\nThe secretary of defence could, in theory, refuse to obey the order if he had reason to doubt the president's sanity, but this would constitute mutiny and the president can then fire him and assign the task to the deputy secretary of defence.\n\nDonald Trump says the US should \"greatly strengthen and expand\" its nuclear capabilities\n\nUnder the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution a vice-president could, in theory, declare the president mentally incapable of taking a proper decision, but he would need to be backed by a majority of the cabinet.\n\nSo how would it work in practice?\n\nInside that briefcase, the \"nuclear football\" that never leaves the president's side, is a \"black book\" of strike options for him to choose from once he has authenticated his identity as commander-in-chief, using a plastic card.\n\nWashington folklore has it that a previous president temporarily mislaid his identification card when he left it inside a jacket that was sent to the dry cleaners.\n\nOnce the president has selected his strike options from a long-prepared \"menu\", the order is passed via the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the Pentagon's war room and then, using sealed authentication codes, on to US Strategic Command HQ in Offutt Airbase in Nebraska.\n\nThe order to fire is transmitted to the actual launch crews using encrypted codes that have to match the codes locked inside their safes.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe US and Russia both possess enough nuclear missiles to destroy each other's cities several times over - there are reported to be 100 US nuclear warheads aimed at Moscow alone. The two countries' arsenals account for more than 90% of the world's total number of nuclear warheads.\n\nAs of September 2016 Russia had the most, with an estimated 1796 strategic nuclear warheads, deployed on a mixed platform of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and strategic bombers.\n\nUnder a programme ordered by President Vladimir Putin, Moscow has recently invested billions of roubles in upgrading its strategic nuclear missile force, keeping an arsenal of constantly mobile ballistic missiles travelling through tunnels deep beneath the forests of Siberia.\n\nAmerica had, in September 2016, 1,367 strategic nuclear warheads, similarly deployed in land-based underground missile silos, which by their static nature are vulnerable to a first strike, at sea onboard submarines, where they are harder to detect, and at airbases, where they can be loaded on to bombers.\n\nThe UK has about 120 strategic warheads, of which only a third are deployed at sea. The Royal Navy always keeps a portion of the nation's Trident nuclear force somewhere in the world's oceans, maintaining what is known as the continuous at sea deterrent.\n\nThe Topol is one of Russia's mobile ICBMs\n\nICBMs travel at a speed of over 17,000mph (Mach 23), flying high above the Earth's atmosphere before descending towards their pre-programmed targets at four miles a second.\n\nThe flight-time for land-based missiles flying between Russia and the US is between 25 and 30 minutes. For submarine-based missiles, where the boats may be able to approach a coast covertly, the flight time could be considerably shorter, even as little as 12 minutes.\n\nThis does not leave a president much time to decide whether it is a false alarm or imminent Armageddon. Once ICBMs have been launched they cannot be recalled, but if they remain in their silos they will probably be destroyed by the inbound attack.\n\nA former senior White House official told me recently that much would depend on the circumstances in which a nuclear strike was being considered.\n\nIf this was a long-term, measured policy decision to say, carry out a pre-emptive strike on country X, then a lot of people would be involved. The vice-president, National Security Adviser, and much of the cabinet would all be likely to be included in the decision-making process.\n\nBut if there was an imminent strategic threat to the United States, i.e. if an inbound launch of ICBMs from a hostile state had been detected and were minutes from reaching the US then, he said, \"the president has extraordinary latitude to take the sole decision to launch.\"",
