            "section": "Entertainment & Arts",
            "content": "Gary Barlow has been a judge on The X Factor in the past\n\nGary Barlow has said the success of his new BBC One talent show should not be judged on TV ratings because they are less relevant than they used to be.\n\nBarlow is using Let It Shine, which starts on Saturday, to find the five leads for a Take That stage musical.\n\nLet It Shine will go up against The Voice UK, which has moved to ITV.\n\nBarlow told the BBC: \"I think people are ingesting TV in a different way now. That old system of ratings shouldn't really apply any more.\"\n\nSpeaking on the set of the show, the Take That star added: \"But I think people are still loving, downloading and buying music and listening to music more importantly.\n\n\"And I think people are ready for a new Saturday night experience.\"\n\nBarlow is on the judging panel with Amber Riley, Dannii Minogue and Martin Kemp\n\nThe eight-week show will be hosted by Mel Giedroyc and Graham Norton, while Barlow will act as a judge alongside Dannii Minogue, Spandau Ballet's Martin Kemp and Glee star Amber Riley.\n\nThe winners will tour the UK with the new musical for a year.\n\nAudiences for TV singing contests have been in decline for a number of years. December's The X Factor final was the least watched in the show's history and lost out in the ratings to BBC One's Planet Earth II, which was shown at the same time.\n\nThe Voice UK, also had its smallest ever audience for a final last April, with 4.5 million watching, compared with 6.3 million the previous year.\n\nThe judges on The Voice will be Gavin Rossdale, Sir Tom Jones, Jennifer Hudson and will.i.am\n\nHowever, Barlow, who was a judge on The X Factor for three series, said there was demand for another TV singing show.\n\n\"I think it's incredibly exciting,\" he said. \"It's something I haven't done before. I've done lots of things in my career. But this feels like something new.\n\n\"And I have to say I think Saturday night needs a new idea at the moment. And I think this could be it.\"\n\nLet It Shine is filling the BBC One Saturday night slot that was vacated by The Voice UK's move to ITV.\n\nITV has reinstated Sir Tom Jones as a coach on The Voice UK, two years after he was sacked by the BBC. The BBC showed the first five series of The Voice UK. Both shows start on Saturday and their transmissions overlap for 25 minutes.\n\nBarlow refuses to see it as any kind of singing show shoot-out.\n\nHe said: \"I've got to be honest with you. It's the same with music - I don't look right or left - I just concentrate on what we are doing and try and make it the best quality it can be.\"\n\nFellow judge Dannii Minogue, whose sister Kylie was a coach on The Voice UK, believes there is enough appetite from viewers for both shows to do well.\n\n\"I think they are really different shows,\" she said. \"The Voice has really settled into what it's doing. I think it has such a fan base.\n\n\"This one is different. We are giving them the skills which you can take on to use forever. But then also it's a 12-month gig. That's a really big job for someone. You come out of that and you can do anything you want to do.\"\n\nLet It Shine editor Guy Freeman, who is also in charge of the BBC's Eurovision Song Contest coverage, insists that there are good reasons for the BBC to have replaced The Voice UK with another singing show.\n\n\"A: there's gut instinct. B: there's an awful lot of research which says that people at the beginning of a dark winter want a real treat on TV, because Christmas has finished. Everything is finished and you don't want TV to suddenly kind of desert you.\"\n\nLet It Shine is on BBC One on Saturday from 19:00-20:25 GMT. The Voice UK is on ITV on the same night from 20:00 GMT.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "The Christmas morning excitement about presents doesn't always last the week, let alone the year\n\nIt is not much more than a week since Christmas Day but how many of those toys that you bought and were received with so much joy are still being used?\n\nOr did you get the latest piece of technology as your Christmas present - to replace the almost identical one that you got last year?\n\nWhy is almost everything these days so short-lived?\n\nOne of the best-selling toys this Christmas was the Hatchimal, just \u00a359.99 for a cuddly toy that you have to encourage to hatch from its own plastic egg. Call me a cynic but I don't see that being the centre of many kids' world throughout all of 2017.\n\nHow long will the Hatchimals remain a favourite?\n\nOf course, if you are willing to spend that kind of money to give your children just what they want for Christmas, fair enough, but for environmental experts the real cost is more significant.\n\nSuch toys are often very hard to recycle, and a lot could be done to change that, says Margaret Bates, professor of sustainable waste management at Northampton University.\n\n\"Eighty per cent of waste is generated at the design stage, so if we can start thinking of the end of life when we are designing things we will get a much better recovery rate,\" she says.\n\n\"Just even using fewer screws or making sure that you keep materials separate, so that you can use plastic and metal but not stick them together.\"\n\nThis TV could be repaired if it went wrong...\n\nThe technology even exists to go much further, adds Prof Bates: \"There are also some clever things that you can do like putting things in the microwave or expose them to a special light source and all the fixtures and fittings will snap off, they just fall apart.\"\n\nThat, of course, makes recycling much easier.\n\nThe trouble is, not many toys or presents are designed that way, even some wrapping paper is not recyclable.\n\n...but if this X-Box controller malfunctions, you might just throw it away\n\nThe trend away from repairing, recycling or reusing seems to be getting worse but it has been going on for years, according to Deyan Sudjic, director of the Design Museum in London.\n\n\"Ever since the 1920s and an American advertising man called Elmo Calkins, who suggested it was the duty of the consumer to use stuff up to get us out of the [Great] Depression, there has been the concept of built-in obsolescence,\" he says.\n\nAnd that obsolescence is getting more and more built in. Some new games consoles won't work with the games people already own. Or, take the smartphone - it has replaced many products like the camera, typewriter and Dictaphone.\n\nBut those items could last for decades. Some were even passed down from one generation to the next. Now, however, people replace their phones when one part breaks or a new model is released.\n\nThe dictaphone grew a lot smaller than this 1945 model, but it has now been replaced by the smartphone\n\nYou can even see this on the High Street. TV and radio repair shops are a vanishing breed. Lawnmower maintenance ones are even rarer and camera shops are in serious decline.\n\nBut there is an exception that proves the rule - the explosion in the number of bicycle repair shops.\n\nThe reason is simple enough to understand: we are cycling more and the technology is pretty much the same as it has always been.\n\nJohn Gallen should know - he repairs bikes at Cycle Surgery in central London. \"Materials have changed. There are steel, carbon, aluminium, even bamboo bikes out there, but ultimately it is still the triangular frame, two wheels, handlebars and a set of pedals and off you go,\" he tells me.\n\nThe materials may have changed but the bicycle's shape is essentially the same as it was in the 1930s\n\nBut even that may be about to change with the new popularity of electric bikes. \"We are moving down that road,\" says John. \"The electric bikes are making their way into the market and with them you just plug the bike in to get the diagnostics.\"\n\nIt is possible to design and make things that last a long time, can be repaired or upgraded and then, finally, almost totally recycled, but that doesn't seem to be happening yet.\n\nBut it may be coming sooner than current trends suggest. Modern technology from toys to mobile phones and electric bikes is dependent on increasingly rare metals.\n\nAs Prof Bates explains: \"There are limited amounts of those metals left, so we have to be much cleverer about how we keep them or we could be in danger of going back to the days when only very rich people had hi-tech goods, because it is so expensive to buy as those materials aren't out there.\"\n\nAlthough you will, of course, always be able to get on your bike, so long as it is not electric. Perhaps one made from bamboo should be on your list for Santa next year?\n\nYou can hear Jonty Bloom's report on the PM programme on Tuesday, 3 January.\n\u2022 None When is regifting Christmas presents ok?",

            "description": "Depression is all too common in refugee camps for Burmese people on the Thai border - and so, unfortunately, is suicide.",
            "section": "Magazine",
            "content": "On Thailand's border with Myanmar, also known as Burma, more than 100,000 people live in a string of refugee camps. Many fled ethnic conflict in their homeland decades ago, and have brought up their children here. Gracia Fellmeth arrived in one of the camps a year ago to study depression in women before and after childbirth.\n\nAfter an hour's bus journey through forest from the town of Mae Sot, Mae La appears suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere. In the morning mist, thousands of bamboo huts cling to steep limestone crags.\n\nIt is the largest of nine refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border, and home to almost 40,000 people. Many residents have spent their entire lives in this isolated place, unable to work and dependent on outside aid. The majority are Karen, one of Myanmar's largest ethnic minorities.\n\nIt is a Wednesday morning, three months after my arrival, and the dusty waiting room is full. Pregnant women wait patiently to be seen by nurses, midwives and medics.\n\nThey will have their bellies examined, their blood pressure monitored and their blood screened.\n\nSince my arrival, women are also offered a depression screen - a series of 10 questions to look for symptoms of depression, which is common in pregnancy.\n\nOur first patient today is 18-year-old Myo Myo. She is nine weeks pregnant. She enters the room, smiling. Lar Paw, a Karen counsellor and midwife I am working with, explains what the interview involves. Myo Myo agrees to take part. We sit down on the bamboo floor and begin.\n\n\"In the past month, have you ever felt sad or down for long periods of time?\" I ask.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" Myo Myo replies. \"We have some family problems. And not enough money.\"\n\nGracia Fellmeth screened many young pregnant women for signs of depression\n\nCalm and composed, she continues her story - a story by now familiar to me. She describes a happy relationship with her husband. Despite his alcohol dependency, he is good to her, she says, and she loves him. They are both happy about the pregnancy. However, there are tensions with her mother-in-law, who disapproves of Myo Myo and rebukes her for not contributing to household expenditure.\n\nI want to know more about her symptoms. She tells us that the episodes of sadness are short-lived, occurring only once or twice a month and lasting an hour or so.\n\n\"Do you ever think about hurting yourself, or about suicide?\" I probe.\n\n\"Sometimes I think about it, if we have been arguing with my mother-in-law,\" she admits. She has never attempted suicide though, and assures us she is not planning to.\n\nA quarter of all women we speak to think about suicide at least occasionally. A smaller proportion - about 3% - have made attempts. We lack the resources to follow up all of these patients, so we focus only on those with pronounced thoughts of suicide or severe symptoms of depression.\n\nMyo Myo has other symptoms, too - low energy and \"thinking too much\" - but they occur only once in a while and do not seem to be out of the ordinary.\n\nWe don't arrange a follow-up but we tell her to come and talk to us any time, if she wants to share her worries with anyone.\n\nTwo days later I am on the bus to Mae La when a colleague asks me: \"Did you hear about the suicide? A young girl. She was pregnant.\"\n\nMy heart pounds. Was it someone I had interviewed? Someone we had been following up? Or worse, someone we hadn't followed up?\n\nLar Paw stands outside the clinic waiting for me.\n\n\"Doctor! We have a suicide. Do you remember this patient?\" She hands me a file. It is Myo Myo's.\n\nI feel shaky. I remember her, and I remember that we had not considered her to be high-risk. Among the hundreds of women we had spoken to, Myo Myo, tragically, had not stood out.\n\n\"Her husband also. They did it together,\" Lar Paw continues softly.\n\nA double suicide? I couldn't think straight. We had seen Myo Myo only two days ago. How could this have happened? Had we given her the idea of taking her own life? Was this all my fault?\n\nLater that day we go to Myo Myo's home to pay our respects. The family sits quietly. The two bodies lie in the middle of the room under a sheet, surrounded by candles. Two cups wrapped in plastic are lined with a fluorescent blue liquid - remnants of the toxic weed-killer that led the couple to their death.\n\nWe sit in silence until Myo Myo's mother-in-law stumbles in, drunk.\n\nMyo Myo's sister-in-law shouts at her. \"This is all your fault,\" she sobs.\n\nLater we find out about an altercation that had taken place earlier in the week between Myo Myo's husband and his mother, during which she had slapped him in the face.\n\nThe death of this young couple left us deeply saddened, but also troubled. Should we have done more to encourage Myo Myo to put aside her thoughts of suicide? Could we have stopped her?\n\nHad it been the impulsive act of an adolescent in response to a family feud? Had a Buddhist belief in rebirth enticed the couple to leave this world and start a new, better, life together?\n\nWe will never know. What we do know is that suicide is too common in Mae La - last year it accounted for half of all deaths among pregnant women and new mothers.\n\nWhat is the explanation? There could be many factors - including chronic uncertainty, hopelessness, boredom, and the legacy of the conflict that led these families to Mae La in the first place.\n\nThe names of the people in this story have been changed\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Two world-leading clean energy projects have opened in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu.\n\nA \u00a33m industrial plant is capturing the CO2 emissions from a coal boiler and using the CO2 to make valuable chemicals. It is a world first.\n\nAnd just 100km away is the world's biggest solar farm, making power for 150,000 homes on a 10 sq km site.\n\nThe industrial plant appears especially significant as it offers a breakthrough by capturing CO2 without subsidy.\n\nBuilt at a chemical plant in the port city of Tuticorin, it is projected to save 60,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions a year by incorporating them into the recipes for soda ash and other chemicals.\n\nThe owner of the chemicals plant, Ramachadran Gopalan, told a BBC Radio 4 documentary: \"I am a businessman. I never thought about saving the planet. I needed a reliable stream of CO2, and this was the best way of getting it.\"\n\nHe says his operation has now almost zero emissions. He hopes soon to install a second coal boiler to make more CO2 to synthesise fertiliser.\n\nThe chemical used in stripping the CO2 from the flue gas was invented by two young Indian chemists. They failed to raise Indian finance to develop it, but their firm, Carbonclean Solutions, working with the Institute of Chemical Technology at Mumbai and Imperial College in London, got backing from the UK's entrepreneur support scheme.\n\nTheir technique uses a form of salt to bond with CO2 molecules in the boiler chimney. The firm says it is more efficient than typical amine compounds used for the purpose.\n\nThe plant is projected to save 60,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions a year\n\nThey say it also needs less energy, produces less alkaline waste and allows the use of a cheaper form of steel - all radically reducing the cost of the whole operation.\n\nThe firm admits its technology of Carbon Capture and Utilisation won't cure climate change, but says it may provide a useful contribution by gobbling up perhaps 5-10% of the world's emissions from coal.\n\nLord Oxburgh, former chairman of Shell, and now director and head of the UK government's carbon capture advisory group, told the BBC: \"We have to do everything we can to reduce the harmful effects of burning fossil fuels and it is great news that more ways are being found of turning at least some of the CO2 into useful products.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the nearby giant Kamuthi solar plant offers a marker for India's ambition for a rapid expansion in renewables.\n\nThe world's largest solar farm at Kamuthi in southern India\n\nIt is truly enormous; from the tall observation tower, the ranks of black panels stretch almost to the horizon.\n\nFor large-scale projects, the cost of new solar power in India is now cheaper than coal and Prime Minister Modi plans to power 60 million homes from the sun by 2022.\n\nBut solar doesn't generate 24/7 on an industrial scale, so India has adopted a \"more of everything\" approach to energy until then.\n\nIts recently-published National Electricity Plan projects no further additions to coal-based capacity between 2022 and 2027, and estimates that the share of clean generating capacity (including nuclear) will increase to 56.5% by the end of that period.\n\nThe firm behind the solar plant, Adani, is also looking to create Australia's biggest coal mine, which it says will provide power for up to 100 million people in India. Renewables, it says, can't answer India's vast appetite for power to lift people out of poverty.\n\nWill India stick to its renewables promises with Donald Trump as US president?\n\nAnd questions have been raised recently as to whether India will stick to its renewables promises now President-elect Donald Trump may be about to scrap climate targets for the US.\n\nAt the recent Marrakech climate conference, China, the EU and many developing countries pledged to forge ahead with emissions-cutting plans regardless of US involvement. But India offered no such guarantee.\n\nSome environmentalists are not too worried: they think economics may drive India's clean energy revolution.\n\nRoger Harrabin presents Climate Change: The Trump Card on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 GMT on Tuesday, 3 January.\n\nCorrection 8 January 2017: This article was updated to change 'Baking soda' to 'Soda ash', and to include more details from India's National Electricity Plan",

            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Diving\n\nOlympic champion Jack Laugher has blamed British Diving after his coach quit his role to join Australia's team.\n\nAdrian Hinchliffe guided Laugher and Chris Mears to Team GB's first ever Olympic diving gold in Rio.\n\nHe is employed by Leeds City Council and worked for British Diving as a consultant but wanted to make a full-time switch to prepare for Tokyo 2020.\n\nHowever, British Diving failed to make an offer and Hinchliffe has joined Australia Diving as head coach.\n\n\"He's achieved things as a coach that no-one in this country has ever done before and it's a massive insult to me and to Ady,\" Laugher told BBC Look North.\n\n\"British Diving and the national performance director [Alexei Evangulov] have really overlooked how much of a key part he is.\n\n\"To have someone like Ady say 'sack this I'm leaving', well it should never have got to this point.\"\n\nIn a statement, British Swimming, of which British Diving is a part, said: \"British Diving is obviously disappointed with Ady's decision to move on to work in Australia, as he has done great things for the sport.\n\n\"We were aware that he wanted to work with the sport full-time and we were in the process of beginning discussions but unfortunately timescales didn't allow these to conclude.\n\n\"We'd like to thank him for all of his hard work and dedication, and we wish him well for the future in Australia.\"\n\nIn addition to Laugher and Mears, Olympic bronze medallist Daniel Goodfellow, Commonwealth champion Rebecca Gallantree and world junior medallists Lois Toulson and Katherine Torrance are all based at the City of Leeds set-up.\n\nLike Hinchliffe, Plymouth Diving's head coach Andy Banks has enjoyed success - initially with Tom Daley and more recently with the likes of Tonia Couch and Sarah Barrow - and is also employed by the local council.\n\nTom Daley's current coach, Jane Figueredo - who heads Dive London at the 2012 Olympic Aquatics Centre - is employed by British Diving on a full-time contract.\n\nAs a result of the squad's successes in Rio and potential for medals in Tokyo, British Diving was awarded a funding increase - from \u00a37.5m to \u00a38.8m - by UK Sport heading into the next Games.\n\n\"After the Games it's really tough for sports not knowing what they'll receive, but ours actually went up, but unfortunately we haven't seen that money travel to the coaching staff which is a real shame,\" Mears told the BBC.\n\nHinchliffe feels he was left with \"no option\" but to accept the role with the Australian Diving team.\n\n\"To really help those like Jack and Chris as well as the other superstars we had out in Rio keep improving, I needed to be in a full-time role,\" said Hinchliffe.\n\n\"Coaches tend to be humble by their nature - it's the athletes who go up on the podium - but it's such an important role.\n\n\"British sport is so successful at the moment and we need to examine all of the components behind that, but in my particular case I just don't think that's happened.\"",

            "section": "Nottingham",
            "content": "While black dolls can be bought online, they are absent from the shelves of many British toy stores\n\nAn internet search for black dolls will bring up about 20 million results in less than a second - but parents have discovered the toys to be increasingly hard to find on the shelves of High Street stores. Why is this?\n\nThree-year-old Sofia-Lily is the only mixed-race girl in her playgroup. She often points out this difference to her mother Abbey Potter, who has been trying to reassure her child, partly through dolls that look like her.\n\n\"They make her feel like it's OK to look the way she does,\" said Mrs Potter, who is from Nottingham.\n\nBut sourcing these toys is not straightforward.\n\n\"I have found a lot of trouble finding dolls of any other ethnicity than white,\" she said. \"I got a Cabbage Patch doll from eBay - it took me so long to find one and I think it was from America.\n\n\"My parents go to a lot of different countries like Mexico and Jamaica and they get Sofia-Lily dolls from these places.\n\n\"On her first holiday, we went to Spain and I found these dolls that were hard-bodied and smelt like cocoa butter. The next year, we found dolls with curly and different types of hair.\n\n\"I would say to big toy manufacturers that they need to evolve and they need to produce more dolls of different varieties: race, disability, size. If they don't, it could affect our children, because they grow up having been affected by all sorts of things.\"\n\nA dark-skinned doll, carried by Johnathan Thurston's daughter Frankie at last year's Australian Rugby League final, was seen as a moment of inclusion and diversity\n\nDespite the revolution of internet shopping, some families' finances do not stretch as far as a bespoke broadband package - and on the High Street, they can find their retail options are significantly reduced.\n\nAbbey Rose, 32, who has 11-year-old and four-year-old girls and a three-year-old boy, said a lack of black dolls could stunt a child's emotional development, leading them to be \"less affectionate\".\n\n\"My four-year-old daughter said she wanted a baby doll for Christmas,\" said the black mother-of-three from Nottingham.\n\n\"I said: 'Do you want a white or black one?' She said a white one because 'they were prettier'.\"\n\nAbbey Potter, pictured with daughter Sofia-Lily, has called on toy manufacturers to \"evolve\" and produce more black dolls\n\nBut why are black dolls and toys absent from the shelves of many stores in the UK? Is the demand just not there?\n\nCensus data for 2011 from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed a population in England and Wales of 56,075,912. About 14% of these people are from non-white backgrounds - so is that enough of a market for toy companies to make big bucks?\n\nGiven that estimated 14% equates to nearly eight million people, the answer would seemingly be yes. Additionally, this somewhat unscientific calculation is assuming white parents solely buy white dolls for their children.\n\nWhile most people in England and Wales are from white backgrounds, parents believe there is more than enough demand for a greater number of black toys to feature on the shelves of high street stores\n\nBut it would appear that a lack of demand is the underlying narrative from toy firms in the UK.\n\nAn email sent in October 2015 by an executive at Zapf Creation - the firm behind the famous Baby Born and Baby Annabell dolls - said the sales of an ethnic version of its Baby Annabell went \"step-by-step down\" from 1998 to 2013.\n\nThe executive said at the end of 2013 it was decided that production of this doll would stop as of 2014.\n\n\"As a public limited company, we are forced to make decisions like that if business figures do not justify to keep a product in the range,\" the executive said.\n\nA Zapf Creation spokeswoman told the BBC: \"Whilst the black version of the Baby Annabell doll was discontinued due to lack of demand, the black version of the Baby Born Interactive doll is still in production and available to all UK toy retailers. However, some retailers take the decision not to stock all versions of the dolls and accessories due to shelf space constraints.\"\n\nLecturer Sheine Peart said white dolls and ethnic dolls should be \"side by side\" on the shelves\n\nSpeaking at the annual Toy Fair in London, Peter Ireland, from Bigjigs Toys Ltd, said the importance of black dolls was clear, but added a firm's ability to sell them might depend on the company's size.\n\n\"There's no reason why we shouldn't stock black dolls... we have far more white dolls in our range as the sales on these are greater than those of black dolls, but if we don't stock any then people are never going to get black dolls,\" he said.\n\n\"If you're [a business that is] all over the world, then you've got a bigger market, but if you're just in the UK, your market's a bit limited.\"\n\nNumerous toy companies were contacted several times by the BBC. The Entertainer declined to comment, while Disney, Smyths Toys and Toys R Us failed to respond.\n\nAn organisation that represents toy manufacturers, the British Toy & Hobby Association, said in a brief statement: \"Toy makers offer a diverse range of dolls, including different ethnicities.\"\n\nLast year, Mattel introduced its new generation Barbies, a moment hailed by black rapper, actor and producer Queen Latifah as \"the industry catching up with what the public wants\".\n\nBut a walk around four major toy store departments in ethnically-diverse Nottingham - John Lewis, Toys R Us, The Entertainer and Disney - garnered a total of three types of black doll on sale.\n\nBBC News came up short in its quest to find black toys and dolls in Nottingham's John Lewis store\n\nA black doll by Barbie manufacturer Mattel was found inside Toys R Us\n\nIn the same store, a dark-skinned DC Super Hero Girl was found - but the vast majority of the toys were white\n\nNo black toys were found in The Entertainer store in Nottingham\n\nOne type of black doll - based on Princess Tiana in The Princess and the Frog - was on sale at the Disney store in Nottingham\n\nBBC journalist Khia Lewis-Todd, who has made a film on this subject, said the toys currently on offer \"do not support\" her daughter's culture.\n\n\"Carrying out the doll test at a school and youth group in Nottingham and going to the Toy Fair opened my eyes in terms of how some children portrayed toys of ethnicity, and how some suppliers approach them,\" she said.\n\n\"Some suppliers believe they are important, but if something doesn't sell as well, why should they continue to make it? Some critics have argued this is putting profit over the importance of what children need to see.\"\n\nAccurately representing physical features is just as important as offering dolls of different skin colours, according to the Race Equality Foundation's Jane Lane\n\nJane Lane, from the Race Equality Foundation, believes the issues are not solely to do with colour.\n\n\"The key issues, I think, are not only a range of skin colour differences but accurate depictions of physical features,\" she said. \"Mouth, lip shapes, nose and eye shapes and hair texture.\n\n\"The main point about black dolls is they are, for a child, white or black, a true three-dimensional representation of real people - unlike book pictures and jigsaws.\n\n\"They need to be accurate because our society is... racist and dolls need to counter this by being positive and not stereotypical of some mythical concept.\"\n\nToy manufacturers should work closely with local communities to properly assess demand, says lecturer Sheine Peart\n\nSheine Peart, a lecturer at Nottingham Trent University, said a lack of black dolls \"marginalises\" black children.\n\n\"If I want to have black figures, Lego figures provide that, as do Playmobil, and I can buy a black Barbie and a black male doll called Steve - who's the equivalent of Ken,\" she said.\n\n\"I can buy them, but I have to hunt them out if I want to buy them as a parent. I've never seen this black Steve anywhere but I've seen Kens in the shops - it should almost be side by side.\n\n\"If there's a black child, and they see no black toys, it almost creates a colonial environment and that effectively says, 'there's no place for me'.\n\n\"It positions the black child as an outsider and not integral to society. It marginalises them. Psychologically, that probably will have some impact.\"\n\nMs Peart has called on schools across the country to help kick-start a change.\n\n\"The dolls need to be marketed more, displayed more and advertised more, and supermarkets can't put them on the shelves unless the manufacturers are producing them,\" she said.\n\n\"I'd like to see schools ensure they have a stock that is available and a stock that is replenished.\n\n\"I would also like to see manufacturers work with youth groups, schools and other members of community groups so they can find out [the need]. Making things happen is not just a case of money and availability, it's also a case of will.\"",

We have held extensive discussions with Jade and her management and she is aware of the risks involved.\n\n\"She has made an informed decision to take part in the show and has ensured that The Jump and its production company has all the requisite cover and medical provision is in place.\"\n\nFormer Olympic heptathlete Louise Hazel, who finished second in the 2015 series after retiring from athletics, told BBC Radio 5 live that she was surprised current athletes were considering taking part in the show.\n\n\"As an athlete you are always looking for the next thrill but I would advise them to withdraw,\" she said.\n\n\"For those athletes who have retired it is OK to take a risk, but for those still in sport this could easily turn into a career-ending injury.\n\n\"As a participant you know there is an element of risk, but there was a part of me seeking that out and it is a calculated risk. The question is whether people know the full extent of the risk before signing up.\"\n\nIn the show's previous editions, Olympic gymnast Beth Tweddle needed surgery to have fractured vertebrae fused together after she was injured in training, while double gold medal winning swimmer Rebecca Adlington suffered a shoulder injury.\n\nFormer Holby City actress Tina Hobley sustained knee, shoulder and arm injuries and has only recently stopped using crutches and Made In Chelsea star Mark-Francis Vandelli broke his ankle.\n\nIn addition, athlete Linford Christie pulled a hamstring, ex-EastEnders actor Joe Swash chipped a bone in his shoulder, Girls Aloud star Sarah Harding injured a ligament and model Heather Mills hurt her knee and thumb.\n\nChannel 4 says there has been a \"thorough review of safety procedures\" before this year's series.\n\nHow would injury harm the athletes' prospects?\n\nJones, who was named BBC Cymru Wales Sports Personality 2016 after going through the year unbeaten, is scheduled to take part in the World Championships in South Korea in June, aiming to claim the only major international title that has eluded her so far.\n\nCox, 25, does not have a major cycling event this year, with no Para-cycling Track World Championships officially confirmed, but she would be expected to take part in the Para-Athletics World Championships in London in July.\n\nAlso among the competitors are retired Olympic cycling champion and Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins, former rugby players Jason Robinson and Gareth Thomas, and ex-Liverpool and England striker Robbie Fowler.",

            "content": "Leicester Tigers have sacked director of rugby Richard Cockerill after nearly eight years in charge.\n\nThe 46-year-old has been on the Premiership club's coaching staff since 2004, took over as head coach in 2009 and became director of rugby in 2010.\n\n\"It is with great sadness and regret that I leave my position. I still believe that I am the right person to lead the team,\" Cockerill said.\n\nHead coach Aaron Mauger will take over on an interim basis.\n\nLeicester won three Premiership titles under Cockerill and were twice runners-up Leicester were runners-up in the European Cup in Cockerill's first season in charge and won the LV Cup in 2011-12\n\nTigers are fifth in the Premiership, 15 points adrift of leaders Wasps having lost five of their 12 league games so far this season. They were beaten 16-12 by Saracens on New Year's Day.\n\nCockerill, who has spent 23 of the last 25 years of his career with Tigers, said he \"respected the board's decision\" to make a change they see as being \"in the best interests of the club\".\n\nHe added: \"This club has made me the person and the coach I am today and I will never forget what they have done for me. I will miss being part of the Tigers family.\"\n\nLast month, following the 18-16 Champions Cup win over Munster, Cockerill said reports claiming he faced the sack and that described the coaching structure at Leicester Tigers as toxic were \"rubbish\".\n\u2022 None Listen: 'Lancaster would be a very good choice for Leicester'\n\nFormer England and Tigers hooker Cockerill spent 10 years with the club as a player from 1992 before returning to Welford Road as an academy coach.\n\nAfter two spells in interim charge he was appointed full-time head coach in April 2009, with Tigers winning the Premiership title and reaching the European Cup final in his first season in the role.\n\nLeicester have never failed to reach the Premiership semi-finals under Cockerill and as well as winning the final in 2008-09, they were also victorious in 2009-10 and 2012-13.\n\nTigers chairman Peter Tom CBE said: \"We thank Richard for his loyal and dedicated service as a player, coach and director of rugby. He has a great passion for the club and for the game of rugby, and has shared in many massive occasions with the Tigers.\n\n\"The club always has aspirations to contest the major honours in the game and that remains unchanged but the board believes this is the right time to make a change.\"\n\nAs a player, hooker Cockerill made 262 appearances for Tigers, winning five league titles, two domestic cups, two Heineken Cups and he also played 27 times for England.\n\nI am not surprised. Tigers cannot stand the fact they are in fifth position and quite a bit away from the top four; they want to be top two and won't get there this season.\n\nThey haven't been there for the last three or four seasons and that is one of the reasons that Tigers have reluctantly had to say goodbye to Richard.\n\nHis record is second to none. He is man and boy with the Tigers and if you cut him in half he would be Tigers colours through and through.",

            "content": "Former Super League champions Bradford Bulls have been liquidated after the club's administrator rejected a bid to save the club.\n\nThe Bulls entered administration for a third time in four years in November.\n\nThe administrators hoped to have a deal agreed by Christmas but turned down a bid from a consortium on 29 December.\n\nDespite the liquidation, the Rugby Football League has confirmed that a new Bradford side could compete in the second-tier Championship in 2017.\n\nThe new Bradford team would start the season, which gets under way on the first weekend of February, with a 12-point deficit.\n\nThey would also get the lowest funding of all Championship clubs from the RFL, receiving just \u00a3150,000.\n\nThe RFL said in a statement: \"To clarify the next steps for all concerned, the independent RFL board has met to determine how the future of professional rugby league in Bradford can move forward in 2017.\n\n\"While a number of alternatives were considered the board were most mindful of the planning already undertaken by all other clubs in the competition structure, the season tickets already purchased and the players and staff who will now be seeking employment in and around the sport in 2017.\n\n\"Accordingly the board has agreed that the wider interests of the sport is best satisfied if it offers a place in the Championship to any new club in Bradford and that such a club start the 2017 season on minus 12 points.\n\n\"Any interested parties should contact the RFL directly.\"\n\n'Everybody has been made redundant'\n\nBradford Bulls general manager Stuart Duffy told BBC Radio Leeds: \"The Rugby Football League have said they have contingency plans in place and someone could buy the club from the liquidators but at the moment everybody has been made redundant.\n\n\"Everyone is very disappointed because we were led to believe that things would come to a successful conclusion on Tuesday. Nobody has been paid their wages for December and we had been hoping to be paid on Wednesday, so this is a bombshell.\n\n\"This is a nightmare for everybody involved.\"\n\nThe RFL said it intends to \"offer support to all staff and players who have had their employment terminated\".\n\nHead coach Rohan Smith, who joined Bradford on a three-year contract last May, and the entire playing staff were among those made redundant.\n\nBut the Australian said he and many of the players would be willing to stay on under new owners to try to revive the club's fortunes.\n\n\"I would love the opportunity to continue on if the new owners and the new management and I have the same beliefs and can work together,\" said Smith.\n\n\"I imagine the vast majority of players would want to stay. Many have told me today they are not interested in going anywhere else.\"\n\nHow it came to this\n\nBradford Bulls were one of the most iconic names - and clubs - within British rugby league, having led the way when the sport switched to summer in 1996.\n\nHowever, the Bulls' downfall has been swift. In March 2012 they revealed a \u00a31m shortfall and the club was placed in administration in June. That August, Bradford Bulls Holdings Limited was sold to OK Bulls limited, a consortium led by local businessman Omar Khan.\n\nIn 2014 a second administration followed, along with a six-point penalty deduction, and they were relegated from Super League at the end of the season.\n\nDespite reaching the Million Pound Game in 2015, the Bulls lost to Wakefield and failed to reclaim their top-tier status.\n\nIn 2016 they failed to reach 'The Qualifiers' altogether, finishing fifth in the Championship.\n\n\"It's an incredibly sad day for the sport both locally, and nationally, with the news of the Bulls' downfall. We can only hope that there's a will, and a way, to attempt to reform the club as happened in the 1960s.\n\n\"Having said that, when you consider that the recent administration is the club's third in four years, Tuesday's news may be an inevitable consequence of the instability at Odsal of late.\n\n\"There was a large window in time during which the Bulls led and everyone else tried to follow - however, the path that the club has trodden in recent years will be one that others will look to avoid.\n\n\"There's no doubt in my mind that Super League has been the poorer for the Bulls' relegation in 2014, and the sport will be the poorer for the club's demise in January 2017.\"\n\nBradford Council leader, Councillor Susan Hinchcliffe, said: \"This is a difficult time for Bulls employees, players and fans.\n\n\"We know the RFL worked hard to support a positive outcome which would protect the interests of rugby league football in Bradford.\n\n\"I'm glad they are now taking steps to quickly re-establish the Bulls in time for the 2017 season. Everyone, including the council, is keen to get behind a new owner who can deliver a secure future for the club.\"",

            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nManchester United moved level on points with fifth-placed Tottenham after victory at West Ham, who played for 75 minutes with 10 men following the controversial dismissal of Sofiane Feghouli.\n\nReferee Mike Dean showed Feghouli a straight red card after the midfielder's 15th-minute challenge on Phil Jones.\n\nReplays showed it was more of a coming together between two players committed to winning the ball than a reckless tackle meant to cause harm.\n\nAntonio Valencia was guilty of an astonishing miss for the visitors before Juan Mata scored from 10 yards after a clever pass by fellow substitute Marcus Rashford.\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic was one of three players offside when he doubled the lead after Pedro Obiang's clearance fell to Ander Herrera.\n\nIt was Jose Mourinho's side's sixth straight Premier League win and their seventh in all competitions.\n\u2022 None Relive the action from London Stadium as it happened\n\u2022 None Listen: 'Man Utd are back in the title race'\n\nDean at the centre of controversy - again\n\nThe Hammers have beaten Bournemouth, Sunderland, Burnley and Hull at home this season, yet their hopes of claiming a first major scalp at London Stadium were undone by the fastest sending off in the Premier League this season.\n\nThere is no doubt Feghouli lost control of the ball and deserved a booking for his challenge on Jones.\n\nBut Dean, who sent off Southampton's Nathan Redmond in the 4-1 defeat by Tottenham on Wednesday, brandished a red card for the fifth time this season, much to the fury of West Ham boss Slaven Bilic.\n\nJones, who was clearly hurt and rolled over several times before receiving treatment, was booed by home fans for the rest of the game each time he touched the ball.\n\nFeghouli is now set to miss his side's FA Cup third-round home tie against Manchester City on Friday, while Hammers supporters showed their anger at the official by chanting 'Mike Dean - it's all about you'.\n\nIn the second half, Dean kept his cards in his pocket after Cheikhou Kouyate's reckless challenge on Henrikh Mkhitaryan.\n\nThis was far from vintage Manchester United, yet Mourinho's team started 2017 as they finished 2016 - with three points.\n\nThey are now unbeaten in their past 13 games in all competitions, while they have taken 25 points from the last 33 on offer.\n\nValencia will surely be haunted by his 36th-minute miss. It was a brilliant save by Darren Randolph to deny him from close range, but the Ecuador international should have buried the chance, as should Jesse Lingard, who hit the post with the follow-up.\n\nMourinho's decisions to bring on Mata at the start of the second half and Rashford before the hour mark proved decisive.\n\nThe pair combined to break West Ham's spirited resistance - the busy and menacing Rashford evading a couple of challenges before cutting back for Spaniard Mata to find the net.\n\nThe 19-year-old England striker hit the post before Ibrahimovic, standing in an offside position, scored a controversial second to complete West Ham's misery.\n\nBeaten by Leicester City on Saturday, it has been a 48 hours to forget for West Ham in terms of results.\n\nHowever, they dug deep, displayed a steely resolve - and might even have got something from the game despite the visitors' extra-man advantage.\n\nDavid de Gea twice saved well from Manuel Lanzini, before Michail Antonio's glancing header flashed agonisingly wide as the Hammers threatened.\n\nAnd shortly before Mata broke the deadlock, Antonio found himself clean through after Lanzini's perfectly weighted pass, only for De Gea to block his effort.\n\n'We are champions of bad decisions'\n\nWest Ham boss Bilic: \"I was pleased with the performance, we fought hard and gave everything. I told my players that if we did this we will be all right in the table.\n\n\"Ten men against a team like this is very hard - but we had chances.\n\n\"I am disappointed with the result and frustrated by how we lost it, but I am proud of my players.\"\n\nManchester United manager Mourinho: \"It was hard for us to think well with one more man - and it was very hard for them physically.\n\n\"I was happy with my choices in Juan Mata and Marcus Rashford, they gave us what we needed. Rashford is very professional and very mature. He is a Manchester United player with Manchester United DNA.\n\n\"I don't feel sorry for West Ham - I didn't watch the decisions. I think if you talk about decisions, we are the champions of bad decisions.\"\n\u2022 None Manchester United are now 13 games unbeaten in all competitions - longest run since March 2013 (18 games).\n\u2022 None Ibrahimovic has already scored more goals in all competitions than Manchester United's top scorer last season (Martial, 17).\n\u2022 None This is Mourinho's longest winning run in all competitions (seven) since January 2014 when in charge of Chelsea.\n\u2022 None West Ham have lost consecutive Premier League games without scoring for the first time under Bilic.\n\u2022 None Since the start of last season, no team has been shown more Premier League red cards than the Hammers (eight - level with Southampton).\n\u2022 None Mata has been involved in 40 Premier League goals (25 goals, 15 assists) since his Manchester United debut. Only Wayne Rooney with 46 - 29 goals and 17 assists - has a better record in that time.\n\u2022 None Dean has shown 14 red cards in the Premier League since the start of last season - at least six more than any other referee.\n\nWest Ham are back in action on Friday when they host fellow Premier League side Manchester City in the FA Cup third round (19:55 GMT kick-off).\n\nManchester United start their defence of the famous trophy at home against Championship club Reading - managed by former Old Trafford defender Jaap Stam - on Saturday (12:30).\n\u2022 None H\u00e5vard Nordtveit (West Ham United) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.\n\u2022 None Attempt blocked. Zlatan Ibrahimovic (Manchester United) right footed shot from outside the box is blocked.\n\u2022 None Attempt saved. Ander Herrera (Manchester United) right footed shot from the centre of the box is saved in the bottom right corner. Assisted by Marcus Rashford.\n\u2022 None Attempt blocked. Andy Carroll (West Ham United) header from the centre of the box is blocked. Assisted by Michail Antonio with a cross.\n\u2022 None Attempt saved. Zlatan Ibrahimovic (Manchester United) right footed shot from the left side of the box is saved in the bottom right corner. Assisted by Marcos Rojo.\n\u2022 None Goal! West Ham United 0, Manchester United 2. Zlatan Ibrahimovic (Manchester United) right footed shot from the centre of the box to the bottom left corner. Assisted by Ander Herrera.\n\u2022 None Attempt blocked. Ander Herrera (Manchester United) right footed shot from outside the box is blocked. Assisted by Paul Pogba.\n\u2022 None Attempt saved.

            "content": "Giant oak wine barrels sit above the bar of the Cittie of Yorke in Holborn - which is more reminiscent of a great hall in a Tudor mansion than than a traditional pub.\n\nThe jury is out as to whether or not the massive casks were ever used as genuine storage vessels - or simply part of the inn's Tudor makeover in the 1920s.\n\nThe Cittie of Yorke features in a new book, Great Pubs of London, written by George Dailey and featuring photographs taken by his daughter Charlie.\n\nThe book examines the histories of 22 pubs. Take a look at some of them here.\n\nOn a quiet street in the heart of one of London's most exclusive neighbourhoods, the Nags Head's first customers would have been staff from the mansions on neighbouring streets.\n\n\"The likelihood is that, because of its location, most of the early landlords were connected with horses, carriages and stabling,\" writes Dailey.\n\nThe pub's main bar - with its 150-year-old Chelsea pottery beer engine pump handles - is unusually low, with short stools in front.\n\nThis is because the floor of the bar servery is positioned midway between the main bar and the lower back bar to the rear, which was once possibly a stables or courtyard.\n\nThe Nags Head is also filled with dozens of toys, penny arcade machines, posters and photos - and the current landlord's collection of military memorabilia.\n\nThe Blackfriar - built in 1875 - stands on the site of London's Dominican friary in the parish of Ludgate.\n\nThe Dominicans are known as \"the blackfriars\" because of the black cloaks they wear.\n\nIn the early 20th Century the pub's interior was remodelled by the sculptor Henry Poole, who created a vision straight out of medieval England.\n\nThere is a sumptuous mosaic ceiling, with marble columns and copper clay friezes.\n\nAnd black-cloaked friars can be spotted just about everywhere - all appearing to enjoy sins of overindulgence.\n\nThe interior of the French House looks more like a Parisian backstreet bar, than a traditional London pub - and it remains a favourite of artists, writers, actors and photographers,\n\nGeorge Dailey describes the inside as \"a little tired, faintly bohemian - but with unmistakeable Gallic charm\".\n\nFor most of the 20th Century the pub's official name was The York Minster.\n\nIts metamorphosis into \"The French\" started in 1914, when its German owner sold the business to a Belgian - but \"The French sounds more romantic\", says Dailey.\n\nThe inn on this site was first built in 1520 - on the north bank of the Thames to the east of the City.\n\nIt would have been a timber structure surrounded by gardens and marshland. It was rebuilt in the 18th Century.\n\nRegular visitors included the writers Charles Dickens, Samuel Pepys and Samuel Johnson - and the venue was known for its bare-knuckle and cock fights.\n\nIt's thought the pub's strange name derives from the fact that a collier - a ship carrying coal - from Whitby in North Yorkshire used to moor regularly beside the pub.\n\nInitially it was just called The Prospect.\n\nFor people heading to London from the south, Borough High Street in Southwark was a terminus.\n\nThe walled City of London was only a bridge away, but it was closed at night.\n\nLatecomers were forced to take rooms at one of the local inns - including The George.\n\nThe George became a home for political debate and gossip - and Shakespeare's plays were often performed in its courtyard.\n\nAccording to Dailey: \"There is no pub in London that can boast of having a completely untouched 18th Century interior - but The George comes very close.\"\n\nThe current building, which backs on to the shore of the Thames, dates from 1720 - built on the site of a previous pub, which burned down in 1710.\n\nIn 1865, Charles Dickens is thought to have written about The Grapes - or The Bunch of Grapes, as it was then known.\n\nHe describes \"a tavern of dropsical appearance... long settled down into a state of hale infirmity. It had outlasted many a sprucer public house, indeed the whole house impended over the water but seemed to have got into the condition of a faint-hearted diver, who has paused so long on the brink, that he will never go in at all.\"\n\nAlthough rebuilt in the 1920s, there has probably been a pub on the site of The Ship since the mid-16th Century - and in its early incarnation it was known as a haven for persecuted Catholics.\n\nThe pub is now just behind a busy underground station, but initially it would have overlooked a rough area of pasture land - Lincoln's Inn Fields.\n\nThis narrow pub on the Thames is one of the best places to watch the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race - if you can find a space to stand.\n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests the Dove was actually a licensed pub as early as 1730 - when the green fields and orchards of 18th Century Hammersmith offered tranquillity away from the City of London, which was then only a two-hour coach ride away.\n\nWith all the hallmarks of a village inn, The Flask is very close to Highgate Cemetery - the burial place of Karl Marx.\n\nIt also claims to have two ghosts - a Spanish barmaid who took her life when the landlord rejected her amorous advances, and a hapless man dressed as a cavalier who crosses the main bar and disappears into a wall.\n\nThe poets Byron, Shelley, Keats and Coleridge were regular drinkers here. Coleridge believed the clean air on the hill at Highgate was beneficial in his attempts to cure himself of opium addiction.\n\nWhen the building now known as The Lamb and Flag was built, in the mid-17th Century, Covent Garden was a relatively new urban area - a smart and desirable address.\n\nBut a century later, the gentry had moved away and the area had become a red-light district. Records from 1772 show that The Lamb and Flag - or Coopers Arms as it was known then - was trading successfully, but the clientele was drawn from the lower levels of society.\n\nA century later, and the venue was a popular location for unlicensed bare-knuckle fights.\n\nGreat Pubs of London by George Dailey is published by Prestel.",
