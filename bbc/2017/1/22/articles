            "section": "US & Canada",
            "content": "Donald Trump has already pulled off a series of presidential \"firsts\"\n\nDonald Trump is guaranteed to make history as the 45th president of the United States.\n\nAnd whether you love or loathe him, it's a fact that the Republican will set a range of records as soon as he occupies the Oval Office.\n\nFrom his age to his bank balance, via his notable lack of pets - here are just some of \"The Donald's\" historic \"firsts\".\n\nDonald Trump celebrated his 70th birthday on 14 June, which makes him the oldest man in US history to assume the presidency. The previous record-holder, Ronald Reagan, was 69 when he took office in 1981.\n\nPerhaps keen to allay fears about his senior status, the business mogul had his doctor prepare a gushing letter pledging that he would be \"the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\".\n\nRight-wing Indian activists celebrate The Donald's 70th birthday in New Delhi\n\nThe average age of all 44 previous incoming presidents is a sprightly 55.\n\nThe youngest ever incumbent - Theodore Roosevelt - got the job aged 42 years and 322 days, after President William McKinley's assassination in 1901.\n\nMr Trump is the first billionaire president. Exact estimates of his personal wealth vary, with Forbes putting it at $3.7bn (\u00a33bn) and the man himself claiming in a statement that it's \"in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS\".\n\nMany of America's past presidents have also been extremely wealthy, of course. Recent estimates say George Washington's estate would be worth half a billion in today's dollars.\n\nDonald Trump has said he will take only a dollar in salary - like former governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger (L)\n\nBefore his 1963 assassination, JFK reportedly lived off a $10m trust fund thanks to the vast wealth of his father - investor and alleged bootlegger Joseph P Kennedy, Sr.\n\nMr Trump will be following in the footsteps of former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger by taking just a symbolic dollar as a salary.\n\nWhen Mr Trump began unveiling his cabinet picks, the number with fat wallets quickly drew the scorn of Democrats.\n\n\"Donald Trump's administration: of, by and for the millionaires and billionaires,\" tweeted Vermont Senator and Democrat presidential contender Bernie Sanders.\n\nFor better or worse, this will be the wealthiest administration in modern American history.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, commerce secretary nominee Wilbur Ross is worth around $2.5bn on his own - roughly 10 times what George W Bush's first cabinet were worth in 2001, when the media branded them an assembly of millionaires.\n\nTreasury appointee Steven Mnuchin quite literally bought a bank after 17 years at Goldman Sachs, and reports put his wealth at over $40m.\n\nIt has been estimated that the cabinet could be good for an eye-watering $35bn, all told. As Quartz pointed out, this is more than the annual gross domestic product of Bolivia.\n\nMr Trump's triumph is also significant because, until now, no-one has been elected president in more than 60 years without experience as a state governor or in Congress.\n\nThe last president with no political experience, Dwight Eisenhower, was Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in World War Two, before he was elected to office in 1953.\n\nSome Trump voters saw his lack of political experience as a guarantee of authenticity\n\nBut as Mr Trump tells it, his lack of links to the Washington establishment is an asset not a flaw - and more than made up for by his experience as a deal-maker.\n\nMr Trump has named his son-in-law, real estate developer Jared Kushner, as a senior adviser - prompting cries of nepotism from opponents.\n\nSome claim the appointment makes the 36-year-old the most powerful presidential son-in-law in US history.\n\nHe isn't the first to fit that profile, however.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson's Treasury Secretary, William Gibbs McAdoo, was also married to his daughter, Eleanor.\n\nFirst Daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner are set to wield considerable clout\n\nThat said, their case pre-dates America's 1967 anti-nepotism statute, and Mr McAdoo was already a cabinet secretary when he wed.\n\nIvanka Trump, Mr Trump's elder daughter and wife of Mr Kushner, is also being spoken of as the most influential \"First Daughter\" ever.\n\nSo much fuss has been made of what Donald Trump owns that you might have missed one glaring absence - a pet.\n\nIt looks likely that he'll be the first US President in over a century not to have an animal pal in the White House, after plans to have him adopt a goldendoodle dog reportedly fell through.\n\nAccording to the Presidential Pet Museum, almost every commander-in-chief has had a pet, and some had a virtual menagerie.\n\nJohn F Kennedy stands out for owning a veritable Noah's Ark - everything from a rabbit named Zsa Zsa to a canary called Robin - but the crown belongs to Calvin and Grace Coolidge (White House occupants from 1923-1929), who the museum says \"quite literally had a zoo\".\n\nBarack Obama's Portuguese Water Dog, Bo, is among the more traditional pets to live at the White House\n\nTheir animal companions included at least a dozen dogs, a donkey named Ebenezer, and various creatures presented as gifts by foreign dignitaries - among them lion cubs, a wallaby, a pygmy hippo named Billy, and a black bear.\n\nDonald Trump won the presidency on a pro-job platform, and has blamed free-trade policies for the collapse of the US manufacturing industry.\n\nThis is a rare stance for a US president, probably last seen in his fellow Republican Herbert Hoover in the 1930s.\n\nIn September 2015, Mr Trump told the Economist China is \"killing us\", and that millions of Americans are \"tired of being ripped off\".\n\nHe said that as president, he would consider a 12% import tax to make the Chinese \"stop playing games\".\n\nDuring his election campaign, Mr Trump also threatened to rip up Nafta, the free trade agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico, which has been in place for 23 years.\n\nThe Republican has long been opposed to the TPP, which he views as a poor deal for the US\n\nHe also vowed that the US would quit the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, a 12-nation agreement, on his first day in the White House.\n\nFormer model Melania Trump is as trailblazing as her husband.\n\nShe will be the first presidential spouse from Slovenia, and the first non-native English speaker.\n\nShe is only the second FLOTUS born outside the US, though - the first being Louisa Adams, wife of the sixth US President, John Quincy Adams (1825-1829), who was born in London.\n\nAs Mr Trump has been married twice before, Melania will also be the first third wife to reside in the White House. The only other US president to have divorced was Ronald Reagan, who split from his first wife, actress Jane Wyman, long before leading the nation.\n\nMelania speaks Slovenian, English, French, German, and Serbian, and may be the most competent linguist to hold the role of FLOTUS.\n\nMelania Trump will be the first non-native English speaker to be FLOTUS\n\nShe is the first president's wife to have posed nude, for GQ magazine in 2000 among others.\n\nMr Trump is no stranger to men's magazines either. He appeared on the cover of Playboy in March 1990 with the tag-line: \"Nice magazine, want to sell it?\"",

It is that stark.\n\nThe mood at the march was determinedly cheerful, there were men, children and lots and lots of women. Grandmothers teaching their granddaughters the political ropes.\n\nBut the underlying message was clear - liberal America has just been shoved out of power.\n\nThese marches were enormous and they came out in cities across the country to repudiate not just Donald Trump, but his whole world view.\n\nThey didn't just protest about women's issues, there were also signs addressing his positions on climate change, healthcare and Muslims.\n\nCan they change President Trump's agenda? Probably not.\n\nBut approval ratings matter - they are a form of political capital and when this many people really dislike the new president, that makes it harder for him to persuade members of Congress to support him on difficult issues.\n\nThe polls show us that Mr Trump is the most unpopular new president in American history. Those are the facts.\n\nThese marches put faces to those numbers.",

            "section": "The Papers",
            "content": "The revelation of a reported malfunction during the test firing of a Trident missile in June is widely covered in Monday's press.\n\nThe Daily Mail says it is likely the unarmed missile was made to crash harmlessly into the sea but the \"fiasco\" caused major panic in Downing Street.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May, reports the Times, will face intense pressure to answer charges of a cover-up after she refused to say whether she knew about the incident when questioned on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.\n\nThe Daily Mirror describes it as \"May's Missile crisis\", saying in a leading article the \"official news blackout only fans suspicions this was a serious failure\".\n\nThe Guardian, which leads with the story, says critics of Trident may now seize on the failure to argue that the debate about renewing the system should be reopened.\n\nSeveral papers report international trade will be one of the big issues when Theresa May meets Donald Trump on Friday.\n\nThe Times thinks it is a historic chance to make the case for genuine free trade, and an advantageous deal with Britain.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph says Mrs May and Mr Trump will hold talks over a deal that slashes tariffs and makes it easier for hundreds of thousands of workers to move between the two countries.\n\nKevin Maguire of the Daily Mirror thinks Mrs May is \"a fool\" for flitting over to America \"to be photographic cover for a divisive, lying, racist, sexual predator\".\n\nBut Trevor Kavanagh of the Sun says the \"world is a reality show... and Britain has woken up as one of the biggest stars\".\n\nHe sees opportunities, and dangers, and has this advice: \"Hold tight... We are in for the ride of our lives.\"\n\nElsewhere, Mrs May has penned an article for the i explaining her new industrial strategy.\n\nShe refers to seeking a brighter future after Brexit, and making Britain a country that works for everyone. And she invites \"the industries of the future\" to tell the government what they need in order to grow and prosper.\n\nThe lead story in the Sun refers to a Food Standards Agency warning of a link between burned starchy foods and cancer - that pizza, chips and toast \"are killers\".\n\nThe headline on the front of paper is stark: \"You've had your chips.\"\n\nBut not everyone is willing to agree.\n\nThe Daily Express asks: \"Do scientists actually want us to lead miserable lives?\" Alcohol, then sugar, fat, and now crispy roast potatoes. \"Why can't people be left to lead their own lives without others meddling?\"\n\nFew things, says the Daily Telegraph, bring families together on a cold winter's day like a Sunday roast. And the paper cannot be enthusiastic about boiled beef, with steamed vegetables but no Yorkshire pudding or wine.\n\nA cartoon in the Daily Mail shows an insolent boy smoking. His concerned mother says: \"And remember, if anyone offers you a crunchy roast potato at the party - you know what to say.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Guardian has reassurance for shoppers who have been unable to find lettuce, spinach, or courgettes on their supermarket shelves.\n\nVast amounts of rain in south-eastern Spain, then heavy snow, wiped out much of their crops. But now, the farmers of Murcia believe the worst is over, and normal production looks set to resume, it reports.\n\nFinally, the Daily Express says advisors to Margaret Thatcher were alarmed 30 years ago when she was asked to test drive a new Rover saloon outside Downing Street.\n\nPapers, made public from her archive, reveal their concern that, as the Daily Telegraph reports, she might crash in front of the cameras.\n\nThose fears proved groundless - she was allowed a practice at Chequers first. But the Sun cannot resist summing up their worries in a headline: \"The lady's not for three-point turning\".",

The people trying to identify Bosnia's war missing\n\nA mid-afternoon congregation of mourners waits outside the mortuary in Visoko, about half an hour's drive from Bosnia's capital, Sarajevo. A funeral parade is due to begin, and finally some families will be able to pay their last respects.\n\nInside the building, work continues on the remains of unidentified victims from Bosnia's conflict of the 1990s.\n\nEight thousand people reported missing have yet to be found - while the remains of 3,000 people exhumed from mass graves still have not been identified.\n\nSomewhere between the two figures is the potential to bring solace to thousands of families.\n\nBoth the tiles and the workers' scrubs cast a green tint in the room, where a small group of specialists methodically set about their task. They sit at tables, sifting through evidence that could help identify the missing.\n\nInvestigators check existing DNA samples and collect new ones with the aim of identifying more victims\n\nBones are set out in neat rows, alongside personal items - tattered Yugoslav-era identity documents, wallets and coins. Some workers squat on the floor, cleaning dirt from fragments of clothing.\n\n\"We do a full anthropological re-examination of the case,\" says Dijana Sarzinski, who is managing the \"No Name\" project for the International Commission on Missing Persons.\n\nAs its title suggests, this is an effort to identify remains that have been kept, unclaimed, in mortuaries across Bosnia.\n\nThe remains of thousands of Bosnian war victims are yet to be identified\n\n\"We reassess previously taken DNA samples, determine whether new DNA samples need to be taken and review all the accompanying documentation. We're trying to find out any bit of information that could lead us to identity.\"\n\nWith the project more than two-thirds complete, the ICMP has so far identified 80 missing people.\n\n\"I'm really proud. The ratio may seem small, but those are 80 people that we helped bring home,\" says Ms Sarzinski.\n\nMs Sarzinski says the number of successes has been small but important\n\nSmilja Mitrovic hopes the efforts will help her to identify and bury her son, Dragan.\n\nHe was a 19-year-old conscript in the Bosnian Serb army who was two days away from completing his military service when he disappeared in September 1995.\n\nOn a visit to the ICMP's Sarajevo headquarters, she explains that hers is more than simply a personal quest.\n\n\"The missing persons issue is an open and painful issue that Bosnia is struggling with,\" she says.\n\nThe next step will need to be approached with some considerable delicacy. It involves collecting blood samples from relatives of people who were identified visually, before the ICMP developed its world-leading DNA-testing technology.\n\nIf there is a positive match with the unidentified remains, it may mean the wrong body was buried all those years ago. But this would offer an opportunity to set matters right.\n\nFamilies would be able to lay the correct remains to rest - and Bosnia might move a little closer towards reconciliation.",

            "content": "Following the inaugural ceremonies, Barack and Michelle Obama - private citizens once again - were whisked off by a military helicopter stationed behind the US Capitol.\n\nThey'll spend a few days on holiday at a California desert resort before, as Mr Obama tweeted from his personal account, getting \"back to work\".\n\nAnd, for Democrats, there's a lot of hard work to be done. With Mr Obama's departure, the party is only just beginning its long journey in the political wilderness.\n\nDemocrats have lost Congress. They've been decimated in state legislatures. Their hoped-for liberal majority on the Supreme Court was blocked by intransigent Senate Republicans. And now the presidency is gone, as well.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nIn the days ahead, the party that thought it had time and demographics on its side, that saw Mr Obama's coalition of young, ethnic and educated voters as a durable governing majority, will try to figure out what, exactly, went wrong.\n\nIronically enough, some liberals are looking at the Tea Party grass-roots conservative movement that emerged in the months after Mr Obama became president in 2009 as a model for their path back to power.\n\nAt the time, many on the left mocked the impromptu outbursts of conservative protest - which bedevilled Democratic politicians at constituent meetings - as ill-conceived, uninformed or ineffective. Now, they point to recent efforts to confront Republican legislators over attempts to repeal Mr Obama's healthcare reform as signs of life in a dispirited party.\n\nDemocrats face a tough challenge in the days ahead. They have to settle on a leader for their national committee - resolving an ideological battle between left-wing populists and those who preach continued Obama-style moderation and incrementalism.\n\nThey need to devise a strategy to win back Congress, complicated by the fact they have to defend 10 Senate seats in the 2018 mid-term congressional elections in states that Donald Trump won. And, before too long, candidates for the 2020 presidential nomination will begin jockeying for position.\n\nMore than anything else, however, they need to begin rebuilding their party on the local and state level. Mr Obama's successes glossed over a party that is bereft of young leaders working their way up through the ranks.\n\nAt the moment, the Democratic Party is a skeleton of its former self. Until they put some meat on its bones, memories of the 2008 hope that Obama ushered in - that they were a party of destiny - will seem to liberals like a cruel joke.",

He's openly misogynistic and racist as well. I see America as a leader and partners in the Western world. He represents such a big nation.\n\n\"Our leaders over here are right wing as well. It's not going the right way for me.\n\n\"Brexit is a concern. I hope we protect the rights the EU offers, such as employment rights and maternity. These issues need to be spoken about. When a nation is doing badly, women suffer.\n\n\"Personally I want my daughter to see what I've done today to show you can do things to change the world and she does have the power.\"\n\nIt was a message which resonated with many other parents as they walked with their children in the fresh winter's air along Piccadilly.\n\nThe march had many parents attending with their children\n\nNancy Pegg, 39, a mum-of-two from south-west London, came along with her daughter Sophie, nine, who carried a yellow banner emblazoned with the words \"Yes to equality\".\n\nShe said: \"This is about equality for girls not in a fortunate position.\n\n\"Trump is a concern but empowering women is the main motivation. I think it's important for my daughter to have a powerful voice and to know she can be a strong force.\n\n\"We live in a male-dominated world. I want to show her anything her brother can do, she can do too. There are no boundaries.\"\n\nAlthough the event was labelled a Women's March, there were hundreds of men in the crowd showing their support.\n\nCar horns beeped to galvanise the demonstrators who, in turn, greeted the drivers with cheers as the march progressed to its rally in Trafalgar Square.\n\nThe Raise Voices Choir motivated the protesters by singing \"Don't let Trump get his way\" to their own version of \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\".\n\nStudent Patrick Bone, from Shepherd's Bush, London, attended because he felt \"progress made in the last decades is in threat of being eroded\".\n\nHe added: \"Trump's election signalled a rise of the populist right who look to blame economic problems on minorities or disenfranchised groups.\n\n\"His election was a catalyst for something that's been coming a long time.\n\n\"This march is to show we will stand and be counted. This is only the beginning. The work begins today.\"\n\nTom Amies, 33, a doctor from Middlesex, walked beside his wife Lydia, 34, as he carried their 11-month-old daughter Niamh in a baby carrier sling.\n\n\"This is for my daughter, he said.\n\n\"There has been a political slide to the right and a sense of misplaced trust. Trump wants to repeal Obamacare. It shows how good we have it with the NHS.\n\n\"There are going to be people there who have that healthcare for life-saving treatment and they will no longer be able to afford it.\"\n\nLydia Amie, husband Tom and daughter Niamh attended the march as a family\n\nThe demonstration brought representatives from all nationalities, including Americans who felt they needed to take a stand even though they were thousands of miles away from their country.\n\nRetired banker Carol Moore, 68, originally from New York, came to represent the Democrats Abroad UK Women's Caucus.\n\nShe said: \"I've come because of the horror of seeing Donald Trump win. He is divisive and will hurt the middle classes by repealing the healthcare act.\n\n\"This march has taken on huge visibility here in the UK because the issues are global. Women's pay was an issue when I worked in the City.\n\n\"There is still the issue of sexual violence and how it's prosecuted and handled here.\n\n\"I hope this is a message to women to recognise they have a voice to fight issues here in the UK and around the world.\"\n\nBusiness development manager Anna McDermott, 29, originally from California, has been in the UK for 11 years.\n\nShe said: \"As an American, I cannot accept what Donald Trump says and I can't accept him as a president.\n\n\"I do hope this sends out a message. 'Good morning. Welcome to day one of the resistance. This is the world shouting back'.\"\n\nAs the crowd moved into Trafalgar Square, the noise quietened so demonstrators could listen to the speakers on the stage, who included TV presenter Sandi Toksvig and Labour MP Yvette Cooper.\n\nHowever, the final address was given by 10-year-old Sumayah Siddiqi who read out a poem to the crowd which had a message of optimism with the words \"I shall stand for love\".\n\nSumayah Siddiqi addressed the crowds at the Women's March",

            "content": "For such a divisive figure, Donald Trump managed to unify hundreds of thousands of Americans at the Women's March on Washington.\n\nMoments after Mr Trump was sworn in as the 45th president on Friday, he delivered a thundering speech in which he promised to improve the lives of millions of Americans.\n\nA day later, throngs of women, men and children streamed into the same area where he made that pledge, in order to take a stand for gender and racial equality.\n\nThough Mr Trump's named was mentioned frequently, the march, which organisers estimate attracted more than half a million, was not only about the new US president.\n\nMessages ranged from \"Thank you for making me an activist Trump\" to \"We will not be silenced,\" but the common thread throughout the patchwork of signs was hope.\n\n\"It's about solidarity and visualising the resistance,\" said Jonathon Meier, who took a bus from New York.\n\n\"And I think it not only helps with the healing process, but it gives me hope for the next four years.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Washington DC is leading anti-Trump protests around the world.\n\nA sea of activists, some clad in knitted, pink \"pussy\" hats and others draped in American flags, ambled about the National Mall, stopping to catch a glimpse of some of the high-profile speakers and singing along to songs like \"This Little Light of Mine\".\n\nPeppered among the many protest signs were images of ovaries and female genitals, a nod to concerns over losing access to birth control and abortion care under a Trump administration.\n\nJellema Stewart, who travelled from Buffalo, New York, said she was marching for her grandmother, who died at age 38 during an illegal abortion in the 1950s.\n\n\"I'm here to make sure her voice is heard,\" she said. \"I marched in 2004 for reproductive rights and it's now 2017 and we're still fighting for the same thing.\"\n\nMs Stewart also said she was energised by thousands at the rally, insisting that it sends a message to the new president.\n\n\"He gave racism a voice again,\" she said of Mr Trump. \"So we have to be louder than the racism and discrimination that came out of this election and show him that we are definitely a force. To show him that we count and we will be watching.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAll eyes across the world seemed to be watching, not only the march in Washington, but the dozens of other sister marches that took place in more than 60 countries.\n\nAerial images showed thousands massing in so-called \"solidarity marches\" in the UK, Canada, and Australia as well as in US cities including New York, Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles.\n\nFor demonstrator Chrystian Woods, the marches signalled that the US would not be defined by who was in White House.\n\n\"It's not about being anti-Trump,\" she explained.\n\n\"It's letting the world know that America is more than just that. America is love, inclusiveness and unity and that America is accepting people who are not like us.\"\n\n\"I believe deeply this country is for all of us,\" said Brooklyn resident Amy Briggs.\n\n\"I would have been very dejected yesterday if I wasn't able to be here and experience this solidarity,\" she said as a young female approached her to sign a rainbow flag.\n\nThe mood was festive among the peaceful protesters, but some were cautious about what comes after the pink hats come off.\n\nLeigh Caputo, a Baltimore public school teacher, said she did not want people to think a march was the only solution.\n\n\"I'm hopeful that this [march] mobilises people because there's a lot of work to be done,\" said Ms Caputo.\n\nIn the months leading up to the event, the organisers faced intense scrutiny over claims that the name exploited past African-American movements and catered to white women.\n\nCritics on Facebook told white women to \"check their privilege\", leading to heated discussions about racial divisions and what the march could achieve.\n\nIt is difficult to ignore the fact that 53% of white women did vote for Mr Trump while the female half of more than 90 million eligible voters did not cast a ballot at all. So what about the sea of white women at the march?\n\nLesley Mansfield, who travelled from Sante Fe, New Mexico, agreed that it was puzzling that so many women voted for Mr Trump.\n\n\"It's a reality we have to be aware of,\" she said. \"But being here reminds us that there are people who think like we do - like the majority who voted for Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nThose sobering statistics did not seem to loom over those in attendance on Saturday, and like the Trump supporters who stood in the same spot 24 hours earlier, they were full of hope for America's future.",
