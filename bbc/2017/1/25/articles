            "section": "UK Politics",
            "content": "It was only yesterday that the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, told MPs it just might all be a bit tricky to have a White Paper, a formal document outlining the government's plans for Brexit, and stick to the timetable they want to pursue.\n\nRebel Remainers though were \"delighted\", that, stealing Jeremy Corbyn's thunder, a planted question from a loyal Tory MP at PMQs today produced in fact a promise from the Prime Minister that, after all, there will be a White Paper.\n\nIt is a climbdown, no question, a last-minute change of heart.\n\nLate last night Brexiteers were being assured there would be no bending, no delay to the government's plans and no giving in to the Remainers.\n\nEven early this morning, government sources were privately suggesting that they were quite happy to have the white paper option up their sleeve, but there were no immediate plans to make that promise.\n\nThen voila, at 1205 GMT, the pledge of a white paper suddenly emerged. As one senior Tory joked, \"welcome to the vacillation of the next two years\".\n\nIt may be being described as a \"massive, unplanned\" concession but it doesn't seriously hurt the government.\n\nFirst off, it shows goodwill to the rebel Tory Remainers, many of whom feel their Eurosceptic rivals have had the upper hand of late. Schmoozing matters round these parts.\n\nIt takes one of the potential arguments that could have gathered pace off the table, before the Article 50 bill is even published. And, rightly or wrongly, no one expects a white paper will contain anything new that the prime minister has not yet already said.\n\nIt's largely a victory for the Remainers about process, rather than substance.\n\nFor her critics this is evidence of weakness, that's she has been pushed into changing her mind.\n\nBut it doesn't need to change the government's timetable, and today's embarrassment of a climbdown might be worth the goodwill that Number 10 will get in return.",

            "section": null,
            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nCeltic equalled the Lisbon Lions' run of 26 domestic games unbeaten with a slender win over St Johnstone to move 22 points clear in the Premiership.\n\nSaints threatened with Danny Swanson hitting a post and Craig Gordon having to deny Steven Anderson's looping shot.\n\nCeltic took a firm grip on the game, only for Scott Sinclair to miss one of several chances as Saints held firm.\n\nBut their resistance was finally broken when Dedryck Boyata headed past Saints goalkeeper Zander Clark.\n\nBoyata had previously lacked confidence and assurance and his displays were often hapless. But he has become a player reborn.\n\nThere was little pressure on him defensively, since flurries of attacking intent from St Johnstone in the first half petered out after the break. But he was calm at the back and passed the ball in assured form.\n\nThis game, though, called for a decisive figure and while Celtic players cursed missed opportunities, it was Boyata who eventually provided the clinical touch.\n\nHe had already seen a first-half header cleared off the goalline by David Wotherspoon, before then racing back into his own penalty area to execute a perfect sliding tackle on St Johnstone striker Chris Kane.\n\nThere was less demand to be swashbuckling after the break, but he saw another header pushed away before rising to bullet a header past the St Johnstone goalkeeper Clark.\n\nCeltic captain Scott Brown has delivered more eye-catching displays in previous games, but perhaps a strong-willed, unbending performance was fitting in his 400th match.\n\nHe was everywhere on the pitch and cleared from a St Johnstone corner kick in the second half. He barely flinched.\n\nHe watched in frustration as Stuart Armstrong saw several curling shots saved or fly wide. Moussa Dembele, too, was off the pace, and failed to convert two Sinclair crosses.\n\nIn the midst of Celtic's dominant second-half possession, there were two moments of typical Brown play. One was a driving run into the penalty area that carried him past three St Johnstone players and earned a corner. Minutes later, he clipped a shot from the edge of the area that Clark saved.\n\nIf there was an emblematic moment, it was Brown's dogged clearing from his own penalty area late on, defiant and strong.\n\nThere is never any doubt that a fixture against St Johnstone will be combative. They are well-drilled and organised. It was not unusual to see Chris Millar bravely stand up to Dembele and rob the striker of the ball.\n\nPaul Paton, too, was relentless. Challenges tended to be physical, uncompromising, and no quarter was given. Runs were blocked, tackles were fierce, there were occasional tussles, and in Kane there was a willing runner up front.\n\nSt Johnstone were entirely subdued after the break, but in the first-half there were moments of attacking hope, mostly at set-pieces. Anderson saw one header drift wide and then the centre-back's lob was pushed over the bar by Celtic goalkeeper Gordon.\n\nWhen Celtic failed to clear a corner, the ball bounced in front of Swanson and his carefully executed volley sent the ball off the upright.\n\nThe visitors were adamant they should have been awarded a penalty just after Boyata's goal, when Brown appeared to push Anderson over inside the area. Referee Andrew Dallas was unmoved, though.\n\nFor all their effort and resistance, St Johnstone could not hold Brendan Rodgers' side at bay.\n\u2022 None Tam Scobbie (St. Johnstone) wins a free kick on the right wing.\n\u2022 None Attempt missed. Scott Brown (Celtic) left footed shot from outside the box is just a bit too high.\n\u2022 None Attempt blocked. Nir Bitton (Celtic) right footed shot from outside the box is blocked.

            "description": "How a 19-year-old Swiss man's appeal for information on his birth family led to a huge response.",
            "section": "Europe",
            "content": "Marco has this image of his mother, who has been missing since 2000\n\nFor one young Swiss man looking for his birth family, official channels had turned up nothing. So Marco Hauenstein, 19, turned to Facebook to try to find out more - not anticipating how widely his post would be shared.\n\nMarco did not have an easy start in life, as the very few facts he knows about his birth mother indicate.\n\nGina Barbara Hauenstein was a drug addict, and during the 1990s spent time, Marco believes, in Zurich's then notorious Platzspitz open drugs scene, where addicts bought heroin in a city centre park, and injected it openly.\n\nWhen Marco was born in 1997, he was already addicted too, and had to spend the first months of his life in hospital withdrawing and recovering.\n\nAlthough his mother visited him from time to time, he never lived with her. About his father, he knows nothing: on his birth certificate, the space for the father's name has been left blank.\n\nIn 2000, Gina Hauenstein disappeared. Despite a police search both within Switzerland and across Europe, no trace of her has ever been found, and she remains listed as a missing person.\n\nMarco meanwhile lived with a foster family. He describes his childhood as happy, but he admits questions about his birth family were \"always on my mind\".\n\nWhen he turned 16, Marco left his foster family. There had been disagreements, not unusual between parents and teenagers, but Marco says his relationship with his foster family is good, and has improved since he began to live independently.\n\nAt the same time, he started to look for his birth family, and in particular for his mother. \"I really wanted to know, for myself, who was my family, who I belonged to,\" he explained.\n\n\"So, when I was 16, I started to call town record offices, and I contacted the police. But without success.\"\n\nMarco Hauenstein's search has drawn in many social media users, including journalists\n\nTalking to Marco, it is not entirely clear why this more traditional search for family members was unsuccessful. Switzerland is a small country, Marco was never adopted, he knew his birth name, his mother's name and, it seems, the town she came from, where her parents (his grandparents) still apparently lived.\n\nPerhaps the idea of a Facebook appeal seemed the most logical, or the fastest, way to reach out. And posting messages on social media might understandably be easier for a teenager than cold-calling official figures in local government or the police.\n\nBut the simple message which appeared on Facebook just three weeks ago has had consequences Marco - who uses the name Marco Julius Schelling on Facebook - did not expect. His message was shared and re-shared across Switzerland and Germany many thousands of times, and soon the media took an interest in his story too.\n\nMy name is Marco Hauenstein, and I was born on 17.06.1997 in the Aargau/Zurich region. After going through drug withdrawal as a newborn for 3-6 months I grew up with the Jung family, and later with the Schelling family.\n\nAfter searching for many years without success, I'm turning to you. I'm looking for my birth parents / grandparents!\n\nWhen I meet him in Zurich, he seems rather overwhelmed by the attention. He is accompanied by a camera crew from a local television station, and during our conversation he fields calls from a German channel, and a Swiss newspaper. At the same time new responses to his Facebook appeal are appearing on his phone every couple of minutes.\n\n\"I've had thousands and thousands of messages,\" he says. \"I really didn't expect this.\"\n\nMarco Hauenstein as a baby, with his birth mother\n\nBut his Facebook search has had some initial success. An aunt, a half-sister of his mother, has reached out to him, he says, and he has talked to her by phone.\n\n\"It was very emotional, we didn't talk much, it was just, 'Hello, so good to talk to you after all these years'.\" The plan is \"that we will meet tomorrow\u2026 I think we will meet tomorrow\".\n\nMarco has also received information relating to his grandmother, an uncle, and even, he says, some hints about the identity of his father. But he seems reluctant to share too much detail. When our interview finishes, he is met by yet another television crew.\n\nMessages for Marco keep pouring in\n\nThe next day, I get a message from Marco. The planned meeting with his aunt has not taken place, he says, because \"I could not reach her\".\n\nIt is clear the social media attention, and then the interest shown by the mainstream media, have caused problems.\n\nAdopted or foster children hoping to meet their birth families, or birth parents looking for their children, are generally advised to proceed using an intermediary, to communicate in confidence, and to arrange a face-to-face meeting only when all sides are really ready for it.\n\nThe advent of sites like Facebook has changed that. Social services report growing numbers of cases in which adopted or fostered children, or parents who have given their children up or had them taken into care, have been tracked down and contacted out of the blue. The brutal reality is that these contacts are not always welcome: not everyone wants a reunion.\n\nTracing relatives is difficult for Marco despite the power of social media\n\nBut for Marco, the hopes for a happy ending seem at least partially fulfilled. One day after the failed meeting with his aunt, another short post appears on his Facebook page: \"On Friday I was able to meet my grandmother and my uncle,\" he writes. \"It was a very moving moment, at last I have got a part of my family back!\"\n\nHis aunt, he continues, \"needs more time\" before agreeing to meet him.\n\nTime will tell if the reunion brings Marco the sense of completeness he feels he needs. His mother remains the key person he wants to find. But there has been no trace of her for 17 years. No one, not the police, the local authorities, nor Marco's new-found relatives, has any clue where she might be.\n\nMarco is not deterred. His search, via Facebook, continues.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Does using art to sell hotels make good business sense?\n\nIf you visit the Emperor Qianmen hotel, near the Forbidden City in Beijing, be sure to bring an umbrella - otherwise you may get drenched. That's because it sometimes rains inside the lobby.\n\nThis is not due to a leaking roof. The \"rain\" comes from an installation by the Canadian artist Dan Euser, whose other pieces at the Emperor include an astonishingly realistic \"waterfall\" in the hotel's spa.\n\nThe Emperor is a \"water hotel\", explains the Chinese artist Bingyi, another member of the team behind the establishment's design. It is built on the site of an old bath house, and it was this, Bingyi adds, that gave the hotel's architect, Adam Sokol, the idea for an aquatic theme for the project.\n\nAt the Emperor Hotel in Beijing an art installation creates rain inside the lobby\n\nArt can be found almost everywhere at the Emperor. Bingyi's work on display includes Cave in Heaven, a vast ink and paper mural covering 400 square metres, over the entire walls of a large space.\n\nBingyi believes that China today is a fruitful place for collaborations between artists and hotels, like the one at the Emperor.\n\n\"Cultural significance is very important to Chinese.\n\n\"We take the greatest pride in our cultural heritage\u2026 we write calligraphy, we write poetry, we have this kind of particular passion to turn every little craft into this magnificent habit of living, and we're just obsessed with it,\" she says.\n\nThe lobby of luxury hotel Nuo displays huge vases made from Chinese porcelain\n\nThe Emperor is far from the only hotel in Beijing to place an emphasis on the role of art.\n\nEnter the lobby of the Nuo, a new luxury hotel, and you could be forgiven for thinking you had stepped into a museum. Throughout the vast space a series of giant vases are arrayed, each one more than two metres tall. They were made in Jingdezhen, home of fine Chinese porcelain for thousands of years.\n\nThe blue and white vases echo the Ming Dynasty theme that pervades much of the hotel's design.\n\nBut they are only the beginning, says Adrian Rudin, the hotel's general manager:\n\n\"Wherever you go, from the lobby lounge to the bar, there are different art pieces, some sculptures, some paintings, from different young and upcoming artists.\" He estimates the value of artworks at the hotel at around $50m [\u00a340m; 46m euros].\"\n\nBeijing hotel managers say that art is one way for luxury lodgings to set themselves apart from rivals\n\nWhy so much - or indeed, any - art?\n\n\"It is a selling point in terms of consumers who are interested in fine art and culture,\" says Mr Rudin. But, he adds, there are other reasons too.\n\nThe hotel is the starting point of a new venture with the aim of creating an \"international luxury Chinese brand\" Mr Rudin explains.\n\nIn this context, he believes that art has a key role to play in helping the new enterprise to find a distinctive voice.\n\nOther luxury groups also see merit in this kind of approach.\n\nThe Rosewood Hotel says its aim is to create a space that feels like a \"luxury private home\"\n\nOne of the troubles of the modern international hotel scene, says Marc Brugger, is that it is an \"ocean of sameness\". Mr Brugger is managing director of the Rosewood hotel, another recently-launched luxury property in Beijing.\n\nHe believes that art can play a valuable role for luxury lodgings seeking to find new ways to set themselves apart. However, for this to be successful, time and careful thought are required.\n\nWhen the hotel was being conceived, Mr Brugger recalls, the idea of creating somewhere that felt like a \"luxury private home\" emerged. In such an establishment, art would have its natural place.\n\nThis meant departing from the usual hotel design process.\n\nChinese artist Bingyi's work for the Emperor Hotel includes Cave in Heaven, a vast ink and paper mural covering 400 square metres\n\nAccording to Mr Brugger, what often happens is that plans will be drawn up and some blank spaces will be left for \"art\" to be added later.\n\n\"That method is much faster\" he says, than the \"holistic\" approach taken in designing the Rosewood, where most of the art was specially commissioned and integrated into the design.\n\nThe design team searched for up-and-coming artists who could create work that would fit well into the scheme, rather than existing pieces from established names which might overpower or destabilise the overall look.\n\nIt took a long time to find the right artists, says Mr Brugger, but he feels that the results were well worth it.\n\nDo collaborations between artists and hotels like these make good commercial and creative sense? Up to a point, say experts.\n\n\"There is a rationale for doing this, in a crowded hotel market\" says Peter York, who has been an adviser to many large luxury enterprises. Companies need to find ways \"to stand out from the ordinariness of luxury now, because luxury has become very ordinary\".\n\nBut he says there can be risks, both for the hotels, and more particularly for the artists: \"It's a sensitive balance between what you do to make a lot of money, and to pump your brand, and the verdict of history - and you don't want the verdict of history to come in too fast\", he warns.\n\nStill, Chinese hotel operators, and the artists they work with, remain optimistic about the future and the benefits that can flow from working together.\n\n\"We're really re-imagining what is luxury\" says Bingyi. \"We just all need to be reminded every single day how beautiful things can be.\"",

            "content": "Most of the papers lead on the fall-out from the government's Brexit court defeat\n\nThe Brexit Supreme Court ruling makes the lead for nearly all the papers, but one of the most eye-catching headlines can be found in the inside pages of the Daily Mail.\n\n\"Champions of the People\", it proclaims, praising the three justices who found themselves in the minority as they sided with the government in the case.\n\nThe Mail attracted controversy in November when it branded three High Court judges \"enemies of the people\" for ruling Parliament had to be consulted over Brexit.\n\nThe Mail thinks it is not good for democracy that this decision has been now backed by the Supreme Court, arguing this, in effect, turns the EU referendum into a \"mere opinion poll\".\n\nThe Guardian is pleased with the Supreme Court judgement, saying it upheld a major constitutional principle in the face of what it describes as \"shameful attacks\" by the Brexit press.\n\nIt think the government should now publish a formal White Paper on its goals for Brexit.\n\nBut the Financial Times warns MPs against trying to micro-manage the negotiations.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph says Parliament has a duty to act responsibly and not seek a re-run of the referendum campaign.\n\n\"What's not to like when British judges in Britain's Supreme Court rule that British law makes the British Parliament sovereign,\" is the Daily Mirror take on Tuesday's Brexit ruling.\n\nBut it is not an opinion that is shared by all the leader writers.\n\nThe Times warns the Lords against trying to frustrate Brexit.\n\nIt would do so at its peril, says the paper, adding: \"Showdowns between the two houses rarely end well for the Lords and the country does not need yet another constitutional headache.\"\n\nThe Daily Telegraph says that ministers are privately warning the government is prepared to flood the Lords with hundreds of Conservative peers if it obstructs the process of leaving the EU.\n\nThe Daily Mail believes new recruits are being discouraged from joining the Army because of historical inquiries into soldiers who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIt says the Army remains 4% below its required strength, the nearly 7,000 cadets who signed up in the past year being about 3,000 short of the target.\n\nA group campaigning to end the investigations tells the Mail that the figures are no surprise, asking why anyone would want to join the forces when they could be hounded for years.\n\nThe Financial Times thinks the world ought to start taking seriously US President Donald Trump's threat to impose trade tariffs in order to protect American goods.\n\nIn an editorial it argues that many still assume he is bluffing in order to win better deals.\n\nBut, it says, the first few days of his presidency have shown that he is not posturing and he thinks protectionism will make America richer.\n\nThe FT wonders how far he will get before he and his country both discover just how wrong he is.\n\nThe reported Trident missile failure may have made the headlines in recent days, but the Times reminds us that problems involving nuclear submarines are not new.\n\nIt reports on a CIA document which has revealed that a Soviet submarine and an American one, which was carrying a 160 nuclear warheads, crashed into each other in 1974 near Holy Loch, about 30 miles from Glasgow.\n\nOne expert says the crash was so serious there was a danger that the crews could have tried to defend themselves - believing they were under attack - leading to the possibility of war.\n\nThe growing number of homes with wood-burning stoves is partly being blamed for worsening air pollution levels in London, according to the Daily Telegraph.\n\nAir quality readings in some parts of the capital were worse this week than in Beijing.\n\nThe weather and traffic pollution have led to the alert but, according to experts at King's College, wood fires were also responsible with more than a million homes now having the stoves.\n\nDavid Cameron explains in the Times why he is becoming the president of Alzheimer's Research UK\n\nOn its front page, the Daily Mirror again has photos of drivers clutching their mobiles while out on the road.\n\nFour months after the paper began its campaign to change public attitudes, it asks, \"When will we ever learn?\"\n\nA traffic officer tells the paper he has heard every excuse in the book from the drivers he has pulled over.\n\nHe says one builder tried to throw his phone out the window when he was caught, while another woman insisted she did not own one, until it went off under the seat where she had hidden it.\n\nThe Mirror says cars and vans are deadly weapons in the hands of what it calls \"mobile phone morons\" and calls for more of them to be banned.\n\nIn the Times, David Cameron explains why he is becoming the president of Alzheimer's Research UK.\n\nHe says there needs to be a deeper understanding of the disease so that dementia is not accepted as inevitable in later life.\n\nThe paper says the article represents his \"first important political intervention since leaving Downing Street\".\n\nIt thinks Mr Cameron is concerned that Theresa May could downgrade funding for dementia research which for him was a \"personal priority.\"",

Kisenosato posed for photos with a red sea bream, a traditional way to mark victory\n\nJapan has formally named its first home-grown sumo grand champion in almost two decades, in a boost to the traditional wrestling sport.\n\nKisenosato, 30, was promoted to the top-most yokozuna rank after his win in the first tournament of the year.\n\nHe is the first Japanese-born wrestler to make it since Wakanohana in 1998. Five wrestlers from American Samoa and Mongolia have made it in the interim.\n\nForeign wrestlers have come to dominate sumo, amid a lack of local recruits.\n\nKisenosato, who comes from Ibaraki to the north of Tokyo and weighs 178kg (392 pounds), has been an ozeki - the second-highest rank - since 2012.\n\nAfter being runner-up on multiple occasions, he finally clinched his first tournament victory - and thereby his promotion to yokozuna - in the first competition of 2017.\n\n\"I accept with all humility,\" Kisenosato said in a press conference after the Japan Sumo Association formally approved him.\n\n\"I will devote myself to the role and try not to disgrace the title of yokozuna.\"\n\nWakanohana (R), seen here fighting Hawaiian Akebono, was the last Japanese wrestler to be promoted to yokozuna\n\nMany Japanese fans will be pleased to see a local wrestler back at the top of a sport regarded as a cultural icon.\n\nAs yokuzuna, Kisenosato, whose real name is Yutaka Hagiwara, joins three other wrestlers in sumo's ultimate rank - Hakuho, Harumafuji and Kakuryu.\n\nThe trio all come from Mongolia, following a path forged by sumo bad-boy Asashoryu, who was Mongolia's first yokozuna in 2003.\n\nThe last Japanese-born wrestlers to reach the top were brothers Takanohana and Wakanohana, who made it to yokozuna in 1994 and 1998 respectively.\n\nIn recent years, sumo has been hit by falling numbers of Japanese recruits, partly because it is seen as a tough, highly regimented life.\n\nYoung sumo wrestlers train in tightly-knit \"stables\" where they eat, sleep and practise together and are sometimes subjected to harsh treatment in the belief that it will toughen them up.\n\nIn 2009, a leading coach was jailed for six years for ordering wrestlers to beat a young trainee who later died, in a case that shocked the nation.\n\nThose at the top of the sport are also expected to be role models, showing honour and humility - and can be criticised if they get it wrong.\n\nMongolian wrestler Asashoryu led the sport for many years, but sumo elders were troubled by some of his behaviour\n\nSumo must also compete with the rising popularity of football and baseball, which have vibrant leagues that draw crowds of young Japanese fans.\n\nBut the sport is attractive to wrestlers from other nations, who can earn a good living. Wrestlers have come from Estonia, Bulgaria, Georgia, China, Hawaii and Egypt, as well as Mongolia and American Samoa.\n\nAs a child, Kisenosato was a pitcher in his school's baseball club before he chose to train as a wrestler at a stable in Tokyo.\n\nHe made his debut in 2002 and, reported Japan's Mainichi newspaper, the 73 tournaments he took to become a yokozuna are the most by any wrestler since 1926.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the tournament victory on Monday that sealed his elevation, Kisenosato said he was pleased to be holding the Emperor's Cup trophy at last.\n\n\"I've finally got my hands on it and the sense of pleasure hasn't changed,\" he said. \"It's hard to put into words but it has a nice weight to it.\"",

            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Athletics\n\nUsain Bolt will have to hand back one of his nine Olympic gold medals after Jamaican team-mate Nesta Carter tested positive for a banned substance.\n\nCarter was part of the Jamaican quartet that won the 4x100m in Beijing in 2008.\n\nHis was one of 454 selected doping samples retested by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) last year, and has been found to contain the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine.\n\nBolt, 30, completed an unprecedented 'triple triple' in Rio last summer.\n\nHe won gold in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay to add to his successes in the same events in 2008 and 2012.\n\nCarter, 31, was also part of the squad that won the event in London five years ago and helped Jamaica win at the World Championships in 2011, 2013 and 2015.\n\nHe ran the first leg for Jamaica's 4x100m relay team in Beijing, which also included Michael Frater, Asafa Powell and Bolt.\n\u2022 None An Olympic career in 325 seconds - Bolt in numbers\n\u2022 None Usain Bolt having to return Olympic Gold 'is disgusting' - Darren Campbell\n\nThe team won in a then-world record of 37.10 seconds, ahead of Trinidad and Tobago and Japan, who could have their medals upgraded. Brazil would then receive bronze.\n\nThe head of the Jamaica Athletics Administrative Association, Dr Warren Blake, said he did not expect the whole team to be penalised: \"I didn't rule out he'd be found guilty but my personal opinion is that I'm surprised they'd go that route.\"\n\nCarter's lawyer has confirmed that the sprinter will lodge an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\n\nThe test and what happened next?\n\nCarter was tested on the evening of the Beijing final in 2008 but that was found at the time to contain no \"adverse analytical finding\".\n\nMore than 4,500 tests were carried out at those Games, with nine athletes caught cheating.\n\nAn anomaly was discovered in Carter's submission following the IOC's decision to retest 454 samples from Beijing using the latest scientific analysis methods.\n\nCarter and the Jamaican National Olympic Committee were told of the adverse finding in May - before the Rio Games - and told his B sample would be tested.\n\nIt was reported by Reuters in June that Carter's A sample had been found to contain methylhexanamine, which has been on the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) prohibited list since 2004.\n\nIt was reclassified in 2011 as a \"specified substance\", meaning one that is more susceptible to a \"credible, non-doping explanation\".\n\nSold as a nasal decongestant in the United States until 1983, methylhexanamine has been used more recently as an ingredient in dietary supplements.\n\nSpeaking in June, Bolt said the prospect of having to return the gold was \"heartbreaking\".\n\nHe told the Jamaica Gleaner: \"For years you've worked hard to accumulate gold medals and you work hard to be a champion, but it's one of those things.\n\n\"I'm more concerned about the athlete and I hope he gets through it.\"\n\nAnalysis - 'It takes the shine off Bolt's achievement'\n\nIt takes the shine off Bolt's achievement. Eight doesn't have the same ring - 'double treble, plus two'.\n\nIt will be really frustrating for him. You can only account for yourself, you cannot account for your team-mates.\n\nWe know it has nothing to do with Usain Bolt - it will not damage his reputation - but it will affect it, take shine off it and he won't be a happy man.\n\nWhen I hear stories like this, a part of me does celebrate. If athletes think they have got away with it, then with retrospective testing they can never sleep peacefully.\n\nIt has to be the strongest deterrent the sport now has. Even when athletes retire they can still have their medals taken away.\n\nMarlon Devonish, 40, was part of the British 4x100m relay team which lost the silver medal at the World Championships in 2003 following Dwain Chambers' failed drugs test. He went on to win Olympic relay gold with Britain at Athens 2004.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 live, he said: \"With relays you work together, you build a relationship, but you never know what goes on behind closed doors and clearly Carter was taking drugs.\n\n\"Carter has tarnished the team. It's a massively selfish act and I'm sure Bolt and the rest of the team are bitterly disappointed.\n\n\"The relationship between me and Dwain, we get on, we are cool. He apologised to me I and accepted it. Dwain has to live with it for the rest of his life, it was a sincere apology.\n\n\"I was devastated when I found out, but you have to move on.\"\n\nRussia's Tatyana Lebedeva has also been stripped of her Beijing long jump and triple jump silver medals after dehydrochlormethyltestosterone was found in one of her samples.\n\nThe 40-year-old has told Russian news agency Tass that she plans to appeal against the decision to strip her of her medals, adding that she \"will always fight to the end\".\n\nLebedeva has resigned from the executive committee of the World Olympians Association (WOA), the umbrella organisation that represents 148 national associations of former Olympic athletes.\n\nNow a Russian senator, she won gold in the long jump at the 2004 Athens Games and has two other Olympic medals, won in Sydney and Athens. She retired from competition in 2013.",

I'd like to announce Dylan's the captain,\" Jones said.\n\nHartley, who led England to the Grand Slam last year, was banned for hitting Leinster's Sean O'Brien in December.\n\nHe caught the Irish flanker high with a swinging arm during Northampton's 37-10 Champions Cup loss and was shown the third red card of his career.\n\nThe subsequent suspension took the total number of weeks he has been unavailable during his career to 60.\n\nHartley will not have played for nine weeks before England's opening game against France on 4 February at Twickenham.\n\nWhen the captain was asked if he had changed his game in response to his latest sanction, Jones interrupted: \"He's had 60 weeks off mate, he's a world expert.\"\n\nThe Australian added: \"I think he's ready. He trained well on Tuesday and has still got a couple of days to go. We're pleased to have him back. It's the continuity of the job.\"\n\nHartley, when asked about his suitability for the role, said: \"We did this last year, talking about me. I'm confident, I feel fresh, I feel fit, and focused.\n\n\"I'm here on behalf of the team. The challenge is to use this week as best we can to get the preparation right for a huge first game.\"\n\nHartley was dropped from England's 2015 Rugby World Cup squad after he headbutted Saracens' Jamie George, but was recalled by Jones after he replaced Stuart Lancaster.\n\nThe hooker went on to lead the side to a Six Nations Grand Slam as they embarked on a run of 14 consecutive Test match victories.\n\nBritish and Irish Lions coach Warren Gatland has refused to be drawn on whether Hartley's disciplinary record will affect his chances of leading this summer's tour to New Zealand.\n\n'I slipped in the hotel this morning'\n\nJones attended the launch with a dressing on his face and a black eye, caused by a fall in the bathroom of his hotel.\n\nHowever, the Australian did initially suggest he suffered the injury while attempting the combat sports England players have been practising since October.\n\n\"First we had judo and then we had MMA, so we're just going through all the martial arts sports to see what effect they have on the body,\" Jones said.\n\n\"My mother always told me I've got to shave and I forgot, so I walked out of the shower to get the shaver and this is what happened.\"\n\nBack row James Haskell has been given the all-clear to link up with the squad after recovering from a foot injury that kept him out for six months.\n\nThe 31-year-old was a key part of England's Grand Slam and unbeaten tour of Australia in 2016.\n\nBut, having missed the autumn internationals, he faces a battle to oust Tom Wood, who was this week singled out for praise by Jones.\n\nJones said people would \"have to wait and see\" if Haskell would feature against France in 11 days' time.\n\n\"He has not had much rugby,\" he added. \"He's played around 60 minutes against Zebre and 36 seconds against the opposition the previous week.\"",

            "section": "Europe",
            "content": "Benoit Hamon has been short on detail with his plan for basic income in France\n\nHe's been called the \"French Bernie Sanders\". After his decisive win in the first round of France's Socialist party primary, left-wing rebel, Benoit Hamon is suddenly the centre of attention.\n\nBut what do his rapid rise and eye-catching policies say about the future of the French left?\n\nWith his designer stubble and cheeky grin, the 49-year-old Socialist party rebel has been grabbing more than his share of the limelight over the past few weeks.\n\nThe most left-leaning of the seven initial candidates in the Socialist race, his programme has been built around the radical proposal of a universal monthly payment for all French citizens, regardless of income. He also wants to legalise cannabis, to tax the wealth created by robots and to ditch the labour law passed last year that made it easier to hire and fire.\n\nThe income plan he has outlined would be put into effect in three stages.\n\nCritics have pilloried the plan as unworkable, estimating its cost at between \u20ac300-\u20ac400bn.\n\nIt's true that Mr Hamon has been short on detail when it comes to how his vision for France would be funded. But that doesn't seem to have affected his popularity among left-wing voters.\n\nBy finishing several points ahead of former Prime Minister Manuel Valls during the first round of voting on Sunday, Mr Hamon has drawn attention to some important questions for France's ruling left-wing party: most obviously, the deep split between the Socialist party's left-wing supporters and the more liberal, centrist line taken by the current Socialist government.\n\nManuel Valls was the prime minister who pushed through some of that government's most unpopular labour reforms and security measures. That left a rift with the party that may force him out of the presidential race in the run-off on Sunday.\n\nBenoit Hamon is going into round two in a strong position, having secured the support of fellow left-winger Arnaud Montebourg, who came third in the first round.\n\nBenoit Hamon (L) resigned as a minister with Arnaud Montebourg in 2014 after they called for an end to austerity\n\nIf Mr Hamon wins, it will reorient the Socialist party away from the centre of French politics, and back to its traditional left-wing positions.\n\nThat may not help him much during the presidential race. Whoever wins the Socialist nomination is tipped to come fifth, according to the opinion polls.\n\nBut it could have two important consequences for France.\n\nA nomination for Mr Hamon is likely to funnel centrist votes towards liberal former banker Emmanuel Macron, whose growing popularity is starting to worry the far-right National Front (FN), which is now banking on a place in the second round of the presidential poll.\n\nFrancois Fillon, Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron are leading the field in the presidential race\n\nAnd, even as the populist campaigns gather speed in France, the appearance of Benoit Hamon at the head of the Socialist campaign could also signal a return to the politics of a previous era.\n\nFor years France's established parties have drifted to the centre ground and voter apathy has grown.\n\nBut now voters already have the prospect of an old-school Catholic conservative heading the main right-wing Republican party. And if Benoit Hamon wins the Socialist nomination on Sunday, the main left-wing party will once again embrace its traditional positions on workers' rights, redistribution, civil liberties and the environment.",

Gina Miller was the lead claimant against the government in the Supreme Court\n\nThe woman who brought the successful legal challenge against the government over Brexit has accused prominent politicians of behaving \"despicably\".\n\nGina Miller told the BBC they had \"exacerbated\" worries during and after the EU vote and failed to defend her and others with \"legitimate concerns\" about the process in the face of abuse.\n\nShe insists she did not bring her case to thwart the UK's exit from the EU.\n\nBut she said some politicians were in \"la la land\" about what lay in store.\n\nThe investment manager was speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg after the Supreme Court upheld her challenge to the government's approach.\n\nBy a margin of eight to three, the justices ruled that Parliament must give its consent before Theresa May can start official talks on the terms of the UK's exit.\n\nMinisters say it was right for the court to decide and they will comply with the ruling.\n\nMrs Miller, who voted to remain in the EU, said she felt vindicated but that her goal all along had been to give a voice to the millions of people with a stake in the process and help deliver \"the best Brexit we can get\".\n\n\"This is about right and wrong, it's wrong that a government think they are above the law. It's right that I can bring this case,\" she said.\n\nThe 51-year old, who was born in Guyana but educated in Britain, suggested the EU referendum had created a climate of fear in which anyone asking questions about Brexit was seen as unpatriotic and \"branded as traitors\".\n\n\"There's this sense that if you ask a question about Brexit then you're not representing Britain,\" she said. \"Asking questions about Brexit is the most patriotic thing you can do.\"\n\nShe added: \"People voted because of legitimate concerns. Politicians have behaved despicably because they have exacerbated those anxieties.\"\n\nAsked if Theresa May and her ministers had behaved \"despicably\", Ms Miller said it was \"wrong of them not to stand up earlier when the judges were being vilified\".\n\n\"I think it was wrong of them to not actually speak up sooner about abuse for not just myself but for other people who live in the UK.\"\n\nMrs Miller, who says she has been subjected to constant abuse including death threats, said she felt her \"family and safety have been put in jeopardy\".\n\n\"The idea that as a woman I had no right to speak out and I'm not bright enough to speak out. And as an ethnic woman I have no place in society. That's worrying.\"\n\nShe said she was still concerned that politicians were \"twisting the truth\" when it came to the UK's future outside the EU and Mrs May and her ministers needed to \"be honest\" with the public about what was achievable from the negotiations.\n\n\"Even now, some of the things I hear about what is possible, as we progress Brexit, it's as though they are living in some sort of la la land because it's pure fantasy.\"\n\nShe added: \"There are 27 other member states on the other side of the table who are not just going to give us what we want. They are not going to give us cherry picking\".",

            "content": "Mahmoud Hussein says he needs a crutch because of abuse and medical neglect in prison\n\nIt is six years since the outbreak of the 18-day revolution in Egypt which swept the autocrat, Hosni Mubarak, from power. But human rights campaigners say the situation in the country is now far worse than before the uprising, as Orla Guerin reports from Cairo.\n\nWith every step he takes, Mahmoud Mohammed Hussein is reminded of the price he paid for wanting freedom and democracy in Egypt.\n\nThe 21-year-old has a pronounced limp and relies on a crutch - a legacy, he says, of beatings during almost 800 days in a series of prisons. Ten months have passed since his release, but he still appears frail.\n\nMahmoud is one of thousands who have been detained in recent years under Egypt's latest strongman, President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi.\n\nAs army chief he led the military overthrow of Egypt's first democratically-elected president, Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, in 2013.\n\nSince then Mr Sisi has presided over a sweeping crackdown on dissent - ensnaring Islamists, liberals, journalists, aid workers, and icons of the revolution of 2011.\n\nPeople took to the streets of Cairo on 25 January 2011 to demand Hosni Mubarak resign\n\nMahmoud joined the throngs behind bars back in 2014, when he was just 18.\n\nHis ordeal began on 25 January, the anniversary of the outbreak of the revolution. His fate was sealed by his T-shirt which read: \"A nation without torture.\"\n\n\"It was a day of celebration for me,\" said Mahmoud, who has dark curly hair and a ready smile.\n\n\"I wasn't part of the revolution, but I believed in it and its goals. It made me feel like a human being, with rights and duties.\n\n\"Nowadays, people see the anniversary as a black day, they worry when it comes. For me the mood was one of celebration.\"\n\nSupporters of Abdul Fattah al-Sisi were allowed to take to the streets on 25 January 2014\n\nBut then - as now - the streets were reserved for President Sisi's supporters. They could gather freely, unlike his critics. Protests are virtually banned here.\n\nWe witnessed police opening fire that day - with live rounds - on unarmed demonstrators.\n\nMahmoud said he was not involved in any of the protests, but that he was detained as he headed for home.\n\n\"The officer who arrested me told me, 'You have my picture on your T-shirt',\" he said.\n\n\"The T-shirt was inspired by the revolution. I saw it as a beautiful thing, not a crime. A country without torture is a dream that everyone wishes for.\"\n\nDozens died in clashes with security forces at anti-government protests three years ago\n\nThat dream was apparently not shared by the police he encountered that day. Mahmoud said they soon employed the torture skills for which human rights groups have long condemned the Egyptian police.\n\n\"I was abused at the checkpoint where I was arrested,\" he told us.\n\n\"Then they transferred me to the police station. I was electrocuted on my private parts. They kicked me with their military boots, and hit me with sticks.\n\n\"Everyone knew I was there because of the T-shirt. They believed this was a personal insult to them, so they beat me.\"\n\nThe aim, he said, was to get him to sign a false confession.\n\nMahmoud Hussein (centre) was photographed with the T-shirt reading \"A nation without torture\"\n\n\"A senior officer beat me and kicked me and then asked junior police officers to do the job,\" he said.\n\n\"They wanted me to sign a report saying I was against the police. I refused. The juniors have their own ways - if beating doesn't work, then electrocution might do the job.\n\n\"I was stripped naked, without even boxer shorts, and I was beaten just to admit to certain charges\".\n\nMahmoud asked the officers to spare his leg, which was injured in the past.\n\n\"They insisted on kicking me and beating me on that leg,\" he said.\n\n\"Because of all the abuse and the medical neglect in prison I now need my friend, the crutch, and two surgeries.\"\n\nHis account is consistent with testimony from others who have been detained in recent years. We asked the Egyptian government for a response to the allegation that detainees have been beaten and tortured in custody. There was no reply.\n\nIn the past the authorities have denied there is systematic torture, but said there may be individual cases.\n\nMahmoud described both physical and psychological abuse.\n\nHe told us he spent 14 months in one overcrowded cell where he could barely move, and could not see daylight.\n\nThere were about 150 other prisoners, including Islamists and men held for rape and murder.\n\n\"I always had this element of fear,\" he said, \"All the time, because prison is like a tomb. It's a place that takes away your soul, and kills everything beautiful in you.\"\n\nTens of thousands of people have been jailed in a sweeping crackdown on dissent since 2013\n\nMahmoud was released from detention last March - following campaigns at home and abroad.\n\nWhile he is back home with his family in Cairo, he is not completely free.\n\nHe still faces charges including joining an unauthorized protest, possession of explosives and joining a banned terrorist group - all of which he denies.\n\n\"I could go back to prison at any time,\" he said. \"They could just pick me walking on the street.\n\n\"Since my release that has happened twice. I was held for a few hours and then they let me go.\"\n\nPublic criticism and peaceful opposition are effectively banned in Egypt, rights activists say\n\nMahmoud has also been receiving threatening phone calls.\n\n\"One told me I would not have time to come back to prison,\" he said, \"meaning that someone could stab me or kill me. I didn't reply. I just hung up.\"\n\nIn spite of all the dangers, including the risk that he could be put on trial, Mahmoud refuses to be silenced.\n\n\"In Egypt my rights and the rights of thousands of others like me are violated, just for dreaming or hoping for freedom,\" he said.\n\n\"Their destiny is prison, or death. That's not going to stop me from speaking out, or caring for thousands like me. \"\n\nOfficials here would not give us a comment on allegations that all dissent is being crushed.\n\nPresident Sisi said in September that \"there can be no return to dictatorship\"\n\nPresident Sisi has said in the past that stability is more important than freedom, but he maintains that dictatorship cannot return to Egypt. Critics believe in some key respects it never left.\n\nWhen asked if the revolution is now dead, Mahmoud gave a swift response.\n\n\"No, not at all,\" he insisted. \"25 January is a dream that will never die. The revolution lives in the hearts of people like me, of everyone who believes in it.\n\n\"The current regime is trying desperately to erase it from memory.\"\n\nAs for the T- shirt that cost him his freedom, he has no regrets.\n\n\"I always say that if I could go back, in spite of all the abuses I suffered, I would wear the T-shirt again,\" he said.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "content": "Dev Patel is nominated for Lion and Viola Davis is nominated for Fences\n\nAfter the #OscarsSoWhite controversies of the last two years, 2017 promises to be a more diverse affair.\n\nIn the acting categories there are a total of seven nominees from ethnic minority backgrounds.\n\nDenzel Washington is nominated as best actor for Fences and Ruth Negga as best actress for Loving.\n\nMoonlight's Mahershala Ali and Lion's Dev Patel are up for best supporting actor.\n\nThe supporting actress category includes Viola Davis for Fences, Naomie Harris for Moonlight and Octavia Spencer for Hidden Figures.\n\nThree of the nine films up for best picture - Fences, Hidden Figures and Moonlight - feature predominantly black casts.\n\nIn the directing category, Moonlight's Barry Jenkins is only the fourth black best director nominee in Oscar history.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. This year, non-white actors have received seven Oscar nominations\n\nThe first was John Singleton, nominated in 1992 for Boyz n the Hood. He was followed by Lee Daniels, for Precious in 2010, and 12 Years a Slave's Steve McQueen in 2014. McQueen's film won best picture but he lost the best director prize to Gravity's Alfonso Cuaron.\n\nIn the documentary feature category, Ava DuVernay's 13th is up against I Am Not Your Negro from Raoul Peck and Ezra Edelman's OJ: Made In America. (With a running time of seven hours and 47 minutes, OJ is the longest film ever nominated for an Academy Award.)\n\nThe two-year diversity drought in the acting categories inspired the #OscarsSoWhite backlash on social media.\n\nOf course, most of this year's nominated films were already in production well before that furore erupted.\n\nMoonlight's Jenkins has told the BBC his film was not a response to the #OscarsSoWhite criticism, having conceived the project \"at least three-and-a-half years ago\".\n\nBut the outcry did lead the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which awards the Oscars, to take steps to make its membership more diverse.\n\nHas that made a difference this year? Hollywood Reporter's Oscars guru Scott Feinberg thinks not.\n\n\"The Academy may claim that this is the result of it flooding its organization with an unprecedented number of diverse new members this year, but I maintain that these nominees, up against the same competition, would have been nominated in either of the last two years,\" he writes in his Oscars analysis.\n\nIn June 2016, the Academy invited almost 700 new members to join, with a focus on women and ethnic minorities.\n\nOne of those new members is British film director Amma Asante, whose film about an interracial marriage A United Kingdom opened the London Film Festival.\n\nShe told me last year that the organisers of the Oscars needed to keep up the momentum on its actions to improve diversity.\n\n\"I don't know the change happens overnight,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm interested to see what will happen in two Oscars' time.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

            "description": "Jennifer Bricker was born without legs but still became a gymnast, after watching an Olympic champion on TV. The two had more in common than they could ever have guessed.",
            "section": "Magazine",
            "content": "Aerial performer Jennifer Bricker was born without legs, but she never let it stop her. By the age of 11 she was a gymnastics champion - having fallen in love with the sport after watching Dominique Moceanu win a gold medal for the US at the 1996 Olympics. And it turned out the two had a lot more in common than athletic talent.\n\nWrapped in a loop of red silk suspended from the ceiling Jennifer Bricker climbs and twists to the music. Her head hangs down and her strong arms let go as she balances on her back, high above the ground - a move that's all the more daring because she has no legs.\n\nJennifer was a few months old when she was adopted by Sharon and Gerald Bricker. She had big brown eyes, a radiant smile, and huge amounts of energy. When a doctor advised her adoptive parents to carry her around in a kind of bucket, they refused.\n\nJennifer soon learned to walk - and run - on her hands and bottom, and grew up fearlessly climbing trees and bouncing on the trampoline with her three older brothers. \"They encouraged all of that by having me jump off everything and scare everybody half to death,\" she says.\n\nAt the age of three she was fitted with prosthetic legs, but she never really took to them - she moved more freely without.\n\nAt school Jennifer loved competing in ball games. \"I was right there with everyone else,\" she says. \"My parents didn't treat me differently so I didn't grasp the concept that I was different. I knew I didn't have legs but that wasn't stopping me from doing the things I wanted to do.\"\n\nThe Brickers had always been open with her about her adoption. \"I knew that I was Romanian and that probably a good reason why I was given up for adoption was because I didn't have legs,\" says Jennifer.\n\nSharon and Gerald even encouraged her to understand her birth parents - Romanian immigrants to the US who had given her up on the day she was born. \"You didn't walk in their shoes so you really don't know what was going on in their life. They were from a different country. They had a different mindset,\" they would explain.\n\nAt the same time, they made sure she felt loved and wanted, telling her she was the answer to their prayers.\n\nJennifer grew up in a tiny community in Illinois. The first time she saw a fellow Romanian was on TV. It was 1996 and the Olympic Games were taking place in Atlanta. Jennifer loved to watch the women's gymnastics team, but there was one member of the team she especially idolised - 14-year-old Dominique Moceanu. She was only six years older, and, as Jennifer puts it, \"very small\" like her.\n\n\"I was drawn to her because we looked alike and that was so important to me,\" says Jennifer. \"No-one looked like me growing up. I didn't know any other Romanian people. I just saw myself in her in so many ways and that was a big deal for me.\"\n\nDominique Moceanu during the Women's Beam event in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia\n\nMoceanu and the women's team went on to win gold, and it was at that moment Jennifer decided she was going to be a gymnast, too. She took up power tumbling, which involves performing floor exercises down a runway. But Jennifer did not want any allowances to be made for her disability. \"That way when I compete, I know that it's legit,\" she says.\n\nShe remembers spectators being surprised when they saw her: \"Wow, this girl doesn't have legs - is she competing?\"\n\n\"But the love, the support when I did compete was amazing,\" she says. \"They would always applaud and cheer because I made sure that there were no exceptions made for me - nothing.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAt the age of 10 she took part in the Junior Olympics and by age 11 she was tumbling champion for the state of Illinois.\n\nJennifer continued to follow the ups and downs of her idol, who was now making headlines for different reasons. In 1998, when Dominique was 17, she took her parents to court, accusing them of mis-spending $1m of her post-Olympic earnings. During the court case, stories came out about her father's harsh treatment of her. She succeeded in legally breaking free from her parents and taking control of her own finances.\n\nDominique Moceanu takes an oath in court with her father in the background\n\nWhen Jennifer was 16 she asked her mother if there was anything they hadn't told her about her birth family. She really wasn't expecting her to say, \"Yes,\" because her parents had always been so open. But to her surprise, her mother did have something important to tell her. She sat her down and said: \"Your biological last name would have been Moceanu.\"\n\nThere was no doubting what that meant. \"Immediately when she said that I was like, 'Wow, that means Dominique's my sister,'\" says Jennifer.\n\nThe Brickers had found out purely by accident. Jennifer's was meant to have been a closed adoption, but her birth parents' names appeared on some documents. Then, during the 1996 Olympics, the TV cameras had cut to Dominique's mother Camelia and father Dumitru in the crowd. As their names flashed up on the screen, the Brickers realised they were looking at Jennifer's parents. But they decided not to tell their daughter until she was older.\n\nWhen she found out, Jennifer wanted to get in touch with Dominique, but she was determined to do it properly. \"I couldn't just call her and say 'Hey, I'm your sister' - I didn't want her to think I was crazy.\" Her uncle happened to be a private investigator so she asked him to contact her biological parents. They didn't deny putting her up for adoption, but after that first phone call they no longer responded. \"It was clear they wanted to continue keeping me a secret,\" she says.\n\nFour years later, Jennifer wrote her sister a letter, explaining the situation and telling her how she had inspired her to take up gymnastics.\n\n\"I almost could not believe it myself, you had been my idol my whole life, and you turned out to be my sister!\" she wrote.\n\nShe included copies of all the documentation she had and lots of photographs - all from the waist up. \"I instinctively made the choice not to tell her I didn't have legs because I thought it might be a little bit much,\" explains Jennifer. \"She's already finding out she has a sister she didn't know about. I'll just wait and tell her about the no legs afterwards.\"\n\nBy now, Dominique was 26 years old and no longer competing professionally. It was a busy time in her life. She had married a fellow athlete and they were expecting their first child. She was trying to finish her college exams before giving birth. On 10 December 2007, after finishing a statistics exam, Dominique drove to the post office to collect a package.\n\nShe tore open the envelope when she got back to the car - the first thing she saw were some court documents with her parents' signatures. That piqued her interest. Then she shifted her attention to the photographs of a girl who looked just like her younger sister, Christina. \"The resemblance was unbelievable,\" she says. Finally she turned to the neatly-typed letter. One sentence leapt out at her: \"My biological last name is Moceanu.\"\n\n\"That letter was the biggest shock of my life and I'll never forget it,\" says Dominique.\n\nShe needed to know if it was true. Still sitting in her car, she called her mother, who lived a few time zones away, and woke her up with the words: \"Did you give up a baby girl for adoption in 1987?\"\n\n\"She had the wake-up call of her life - it was just so blunt,\" she admits.\n\nHer mother burst into tears. She said \"Yes\" but could barely say anything else.\n\n\"My heart broke for her because she had to keep this a secret for all these years and she could never have had the opportunity to deal with it,\" says Dominique.\n\nThe next few weeks were an emotional rollercoaster. Dominique wrote back to Jennifer, asking for time to process the news and explaining that she was about to have a baby.\n\n\"I needed to answer some of my own questions and figure out how this could have happened,\" says Dominique.\n\nAt the time her father was very ill so it was difficult to communicate with him, but Dominique found out that he had made the decision to give Jennifer up at the hospital out of fear that they would not be able to pay her medical bills. Her mother had not had a say in it, and had never even got the chance to hold her.\n\nDominique's own daughter was born on Christmas Day and a few weeks later, on 14 January, she felt ready to call her sister for the first time. She was nervous and had even prepared notes, but the conversation soon flowed.\n\nThen Jennifer bit the bullet. \"By the way, you know I don't have legs right?\" she said.\n\nDominique was stunned into silence. How did this fit with what she knew?\n\n\"She told me that I was the reason she started gymnastics, and I thought that was a beautiful thing,\" says Dominique. \"I never imagined she would do all of these sports without having legs.\"\n\nThat spring, Dominique, Jennifer and their younger sister Christina met for the first time in Ohio, where Dominique lived.\n\n\"On one hand it was surreal and a bit like a dream,\" says Jennifer. \"But on the other hand it was very natural. The DNA was very clear at that point. When I met my younger sister it was like looking in a mirror.\"\n\nThe sisters marvelled at all the things they had in common - the way they laughed, even certain hand gestures - but when they spoke about their upbringing, their stories could not have been more different.\n\n\"They did not have the love and support that I had. They had some abuse and turmoil and secrets so it was not an easy childhood for them,\" says Jennifer.\n\nThe Moceanus, themselves former gymnasts, had come to the US in 1981, after fleeing the Ceausescu regime in Romania. Dominique was born shortly after they arrived, and they dreamed she would be the next Nadia Comaneci.\n\nWhen she was six months old they hung her on the washing line to test her strength - she held on until the line broke. \"That was a sign to them I'd be a great gymnast,\" says Dominique. It was a story her father loved to tell - unfortunately the training methods he and the coaches espoused were a hangover from the communist era.\n\nDominique says she was constantly humiliated and berated about her weight and any shortcomings in her performance. \"People thought these measures were the way you had to succeed,\" she says. \"But those kinds of things are really damaging to the self-esteem when you're a young, growing, pre-pubescent child.\" There was also the threat of physical punishment from her father if her performance was not up to scratch. He was an authoritarian figure who dominated the household.\n\n\"We all agree that it would not have been a great childhood environment for me to grow up in,\" says Jennifer.\n\n\"My parents had never been around many children with disabilities,\" says Dominique.\n\nTheir father died before Jennifer could meet him, but in January 2010, at the age of 22, she met her biological mother, Camelia, for the first time.\n\n\"I remember it in slow motion,\" says Jennifer.\n\n\"She was wearing a fur hat - it was such a stereotypical Eastern European thing.\n\n\"She couldn't believe how much I looked like my sisters and so she was instinctively speaking in Romanian.\" Dominique had to translate for her mother, who was too stunned to switch to English.\n\nThe women hugged, and Jennifer showed her videos of her performances, including a trampoline act she had performed on tour with Britney Spears. \"She was so amazed and she knew that she could have never given me that life,\" she says.\n\nJennifer felt no anger towards her. She credits her adoptive parents for this. \"They gave me the freedom not to be bitter,\" she says.\n\nJennifer with her parents, Sharon and Gerald Bricker\n\nIn fact, she says her heart went out to her mother.\n\n\"You know, my biological mother was very much a victim of an abusive marriage,\" she says. \"She did not have an easy life - and that's not me making an excuse for her, that's just the truth.\"\n\nThe sisters live in separate states but try to see each other when they can, making up for lost time. Jennifer now travels the world as an inspirational speaker and performs as an aerial acrobat.\n\n\"She's wonderful, she's up there in the air and you can see her passion,\" says Dominique. \"I'm proud of her as an older sister - she's really living her dreams.\"\n\nListen to Dominique and Jennifer speak to Outlook on the BBC World Service\n\nImages of Jennifer Bricker taken from Everything is Possible by Jen Bricker with Sheryl Berk.
