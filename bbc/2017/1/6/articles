            "section": "In Pictures",
            "content": "During its 11-year-long civil war, Sierra Leone became famous for blood diamonds.\n\nRebel and government groups fought brutally over diamond-rich territory in the north of the country and funded themselves by selling the stones to international buyers.\n\nFourteen years after the conflict ended, diamond mining operations are still under way in the northern district of Kono.\n\nA South African company, Koidu Holdings, runs a large mine that uses sophisticated machinery to blast through kimberlite and identify diamond-dense areas in the deep earth.\n\nOne of these miners, Philo, has worked in Kono for the past 23 years, but was driven out during the conflict and lived in Guinea as a refugee.\n\nWhen the war simmered down in December 2000, he returned home and started diamond mining again a year later.\n\nMany artisanal miners will admit that they have not found a diamond in months and are desperately poor.\n\nYet in a country where there is 70% youth unemployment, mining at least provides some form of livelihood.\n\nMost men mine in a team of three.\n\nOne of them dives to scoop a bucket of mud and grit from the riverbed, while another man holds him down so he does not drift with the tide.\n\nThe third collects the bucket and empties it into a mound.\n\nOnce there is enough, the sifting begins.\n\nThe three men swap roles regularly, to avoid getting too cold.\n\nPhilo complains of chills when he gets out of the water and sucks a packet of cheap rum to warm up, saying: \"This work is tough and physically straining - if I had the qualifications or opportunity to do another job then I would at once.\"\n\nThe swampy area around the river has been dug out by artisanal miners, who are dotted all over, urgently scooping mud and sifting through it.\n\nAt last, after three hours of sifting, Philo is thrilled to have found a tiny diamond.\n\nSome miners are able to invest in what is known as a \"rocker\".\n\nThey use a power hose to squirt water through a layer of mud piled on to fine mesh.\n\nOnce the mud is cleared they are more likely to spot a glinting diamond.\n\nHowever, Philo does not have this luxury.\n\n\"We are not able to afford this kind of machinery, we have to manage with just a bucket, spade and shaker [sieve],\" he says.\n\nIn the local market each shaker sells for 25,000 Leones (about \u00a33.50).\n\nSoon after Philo has discovered a diamond, he packs up early and heads into town with his team.\n\nHe is happy, saying: \"This was a very good day, we hadn't seen a diamond for nearly a month.\"\n\nOn the way to his house, he bumps into his elder brother outside a shop.\n\nThey greet each other in front of the rocky kimberlite mountain that has been created by Koidu Holdings' blasts.\n\nPhilo says that he is jealous of their machinery and wealth, especially as diamonds in shallow ground are running out.\n\nBack home, Philo relaxes in his room with his uncle.\n\nDuring the conflict his mother was shot and killed by rebels, just outside the room in which he is now sitting.\n\nHis whole house was burned down and had to be rebuilt.\n\nThe following day Philo heads into Koidu town to sell his diamond in an office just off the high street.\n\nThe going rate is $3,200 (\u00a32,520) for a carat that is 40% pure, and much less for gems of lower purity.\n\nPhilo obtains only $35 (about \u00a328) for his find, but he is pleased as it is more than he had expected.",

            "content": "Nearly 30 years after that famous broadcast in which he dismissed reports that a hurricane was about to batter the south of England, former BBC weatherman Michael Fish is being compared with the failures of economic forecasters.\n\nThe admission by a top Bank of England official that economists failed to predict the 2008 financial crisis and were wrong about their dire warnings over the post-Brexit economy, make the lead for the Times, Telegraph and Guardian.\n\nThey highlight the comment by the Bank's chief economist, Andy Haldane, that the shortcomings were a \"Michael Fish moment\" for the profession.\n\nThe Guardian says Mr Haldane is known to be concerned about mounting criticism of experts and the potential for the Bank's forecasts to be dismissed by politicians if errors persist.\n\nAccording to the lead in the Financial Times, the appointment of Sir Tim Barrow as Britain's ambassador to the EU following the resignation of Sir Ivan Rogers was \"vigorously opposed\" by the top official at the Brexit ministry.\n\nSeveral unnamed officials have told the paper that Olly Robbins, permanent secretary at the department, wanted to take control of negotiations with Brussels, and suggested downgrading the job of UK ambassador to a director-general, with a reporting line to Mr Robbins.\n\nBut, the paper goes on, the Foreign Office sees it as a vital diplomatic post and moved to block Mr Robbins.\n\nThe Department for Brexit tells the paper the claims are \"fundamentally untrue.\"\n\nFor its main story, the Mail says senior civil servants have made an extraordinary demand for extra cash to deal with Brexit.\n\nAccording to the paper, the Whitehall mandarins and diplomats say the vote to leave the EU has left them facing \"unsustainable\" pressure.\n\nIt says the First Division Association - a union representing elite civil servants earning up to \u00a3208,000 - has called for an end to the system that limits increases to 10% for officials who win promotion and a lifting of the 1% pay cap.\n\nThe Mail also gives over much of its front page to a tribute to Jill Saward, the woman raped at an Ealing vicarage in 1986 who went on to campaign for the police and courts to treat victims better.\n\nShe died on Thursday at the age of 51. The paper thinks it is a disgrace that she never received an honour.\n\nEaling rape victim Jill Saward waived her right to anonymity\n\n\"Doesn't it say it all about our rotten honours system that while vapid celebrities and self-serving mandarins are showered with gongs, a woman of grit and integrity who immeasurably improved the lives of countless others got nothing?\" it asks.\n\nThe Mirror says she was inspiring, courageous and remarkable.\n\nFinally, there is some timely advice on how to avoid falling on icy surfaces - march like a penguin.\n\nAccording to the Times, penguins may look silly as they waddle around on their stubby legs but their walk is the ideal way to stay safe in cold weather.\n\nNo slips: Penguins appear to push their centre of gravity forward\n\nA German study has found that penguins manage to stay upright by leaning forward so the centre of gravity lies on their front leg, whereas we usually split our weight between two legs - causing them to lose balance on slippery surfaces.",

            "description": "Japan has one of the lowest rates of gun crime in the world, and the rules around ownership are very strict.",
            "section": "Magazine",
            "content": "Shotguns and air rifles are the only firearms you can legally buy in Japan\n\nJapan has one of the lowest rates of gun crime in the world. In 2014 there were just six gun deaths, compared to 33,599 in the US.\n\nIf you want to buy a gun in Japan you need patience and determination. You have to attend an all-day class, take a written exam and pass a shooting-range test with a mark of at least 95%.\n\nThere are also mental health and drugs tests. Your criminal record is checked and police look for links to extremist groups. Then they check your relatives too - and even your work colleagues. And as well as having the power to deny gun licences, police also have sweeping powers to search and seize weapons.\n\nThat's not all. Handguns are banned outright. Only shotguns and air rifles are allowed.\n\nThe law restricts the number of gun shops. In most of Japan's 40 or so prefectures there can be no more than three, and you can only buy fresh cartridges by returning the spent cartridges you bought on your last visit.\n\nA photo posed by models - even Japanese gangsters rarely use guns these days\n\nPolice must be notified where the gun and the ammunition are stored - and they must be stored separately under lock and key. Police will also inspect guns once a year. And after three years your licence runs out, at which point you have to attend the course and pass the tests again.\n\nThis helps explain why mass shootings in Japan are extremely rare. When mass killings occur, the killer most often wields a knife.\n\nIn a world where a lot is going wrong there is also a lot going right. So what if you could build a country with policies that actually worked, by homing in ideas around the world that have been truly successful?\n\nThe current gun control law was introduced in 1958, but the idea behind the policy dates back centuries.\n\n\"Ever since guns entered the country, Japan has always had strict gun laws,\" says Iain Overton, executive director of Action on Armed Violence and the author of Gun Baby Gun.\n\n\"They are the first nation to impose gun laws in the whole world and I think it laid down a bedrock saying that guns really don't play a part in civilian society.\"\n\nPeople were being rewarded for giving up firearms as far back as 1685, a policy Overton describes as \"perhaps the first ever gun buyback initiative\".\n\n\"The moment you have guns in society, you will have gun violence but I think it's about the quantity,\" says Overton. \"If you have very few guns in society, you will almost inevitably have low levels of violence.\"\n\nJapanese police officers rarely use guns and put much greater emphasis on martial arts - all are expected to become a black belt in judo. They spend more time practising kendo (fighting with bamboo swords) than learning how to use firearms.\n\n\"The response to violence is never violence, it's always to de-escalate it. Only six shots were fired by Japanese police nationwide [in 2015],\" says journalist Anthony Berteaux. \"What most Japanese police will do is get huge futons and essentially roll up a person who is being violent or drunk into a little burrito and carry them back to the station to calm them down.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Japanese police practise martial arts every week and avoid using weapons whenever they can\n\nOverton contrasts this with the American model, which he says has been \"to militarise the police\".\n\n\"If you have too many police pulling out guns at the first instance of crime, you lead to a miniature arms race between police and criminals,\" he says.\n\nTo underline the taboo attached to inappropriate use of weapons, an officer who used his gun to kill himself was charged posthumously with a criminal offence. He carried out the act while on duty - policemen never carry weapons off-duty, leaving them at the station when they finish their shift.\n\nThe care police take with firearms is mirrored in the self-defence forces.\n\nJournalist Jake Adelstein once attended a shooting practice, which ended with the gathering up of the bullet casings - and there was great concern when one turned out to be missing.\n\n\"One bullet shell was unaccounted for - one shell had fallen behind one of the targets - and nobody was allowed to leave the facilities until they found the shell,\" he says.\n\nThere is no clamour in Japan for gun regulations to be relaxed, says Berteaux. \"A lot of it stems from this post-war sentiment of pacifism that the war was horrible and we can never have that again,\" he explains.\n\nThere are a limited number of longstanding rifle owners in Japan - when they die their heirs must hand the rifles in\n\n\"People assume that peace is always going to exist and when you have a culture like that you don't really feel the need to arm yourself or have an object that disrupts that peace.\"\n\nIn fact, moves to expand the role of Japan's self-defence forces in foreign peacekeeping operations have caused concern in some quarters.\n\n\"It is unknown territory,\" says political science professor Koichi Nakano. \"Maybe the government will try to normalise occasional death in the self-defence force and perhaps even try to glorify the exercise of weapons?\"\n\nAccording to Iain Overton, the \"almost taboo level of rejection\" of guns in Japan means that the country is \"edging towards a perfect place\" - though he points out that Iceland also achieves a very low rate of gun crime, despite a much higher level of gun ownership.\n\nHenrietta Moore of the Institute for Global Prosperity at University College London applauds the Japanese for not viewing gun ownership as \"a civil liberty\", and rejecting the idea of firearms as \"something you use to defend your property against others\".\n\nBut for Japanese gangsters the tight gun control laws are a problem. Yakuza gun crime has sharply declined in the last 15 years, but those who continue to carry firearms have to find ingenious ways of smuggling them into the country.\n\n\"The criminals pack the guns inside of a tuna so it looks like a frozen tuna,\" says retired police officer Tahei Ogawa. \"But we have discovered cases where they have actually hidden a gun inside.\"\n\nJoin the conversation - find the BBC World Service on Facebook and Twitter.",

            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nPep Guardiola's first taste of the FA Cup ended triumphantly as his Manchester City side thrashed Premier League rivals West Ham in the third round.\n\nCity led 3-0 at the break, Yaya Toure starting the rout by firing a debatable penalty into the bottom left corner.\n\nHavard Nordtveit bundled Bacary Sagna's teasing cross into his own net, just 146 seconds before David Silva's composed tap-in.\n\nShortly after the restart, Sergio Aguero cheekily diverted in Toure's shot to become the third-highest goalscorer in City's history.\n\nAnd John Stones headed in his first Blues goal as the visitors comfortably saw the game out in a rapidly emptying London Stadium.\n\nFollowing Friday's opening third-round tie, City are the first team in the pot for Monday's draw, which is live on BBC Two and online at 19:00 GMT.\n\nWatch all the FA Cup goals and read the reaction\n\nGuardiola has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks thanks to a combination of City's faltering form and his tetchy interviews.\n\nBut his team responded with a devastating performance against the hapless Hammers.\n\nWest Ham could not cope with the pace, power and precision of the visitors.\n\nToure whipped in the spot-kick after Pablo Zabaleta fell over Angelo Ogbonna's standing leg before Nordtveit and Silva ensured City scored three first-half goals for the first time under their Spanish manager.\n\nThe Blues were relentless as they condemned West Ham to their heaviest FA Cup home defeat.\n\nFormer Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach Guardiola has regularly been forced into defending his footballing philosophy in recent months but performances like this justify his perseverance.\n\n\"West Ham could not live with their passing, their movement, their one-touch football,\" former England striker Alan Shearer said on Match of the Day.\n\nHammers manager Slaven Bilic claimed ahead of the game that City \"were not that confident anymore\" after Guardiola's methods had been questioned following his team's mixed form in the past couple of months.\n\nHow wrong the Croat was.\n\nBut that, in part, was down to his team's inability - or refusal - to put the away side under any serious pressure when they were in possession.\n\nSign up for the 2017 FA People's Cup and take your chance to win tickets to the FA Cup final and achieve national five-a-side glory.\n\nThe Hammers failed to press the visitors in their own half, allowing Toure - who had more touches and made more passes than anyone else in his 78 minutes on the pitch - to dictate from his holding midfield role.\n\nHowever, it could all have been very different had Sofiane Feghouli not spurned a golden chance to pull the Hammers level at 1-1.\n\nThe Algeria winger - only playing after his red card against Manchester United was rescinded - sidefooted wide of a gaping goal just seconds after Toure's penalty.\n\nAnd that proved the catalyst for the Hammers' collapse.\n\n\"The way West Ham's heads went down is alarming. Alarming for the fans and for the manager. It was embarrassing,\" Shearer added.\n\nThe Hammers have struggled for consistency in front of goal this season, scoring just 23 times in their 20 Premier League matches - four of which were netted against Swansea on Boxing Day.\n\nRegular injuries to Andy Carroll, Diafra Sakho and Andre Ayew have not helped matters, nor has on-loan Juventus forward Simone Zaza's inability to find his feet - or the net - in England.\n\nNo wonder they have targeted an attacker in this transfer window, already having bids turned down for Sunderland's Jermain Defoe and Hull City's Robert Snodgrass.\n\nThis was another toothless performance. And, like the humiliating 5-1 defeat against Arsenal last month, they were worryingly disorganised and open at the back.\n\nWith some home fans leaving after City's third goal and those left at the final whistle jeering his team, could Hammers hero Bilic be starting to come under pressure?\n\nWhat they said\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"We were able to keep the ball more than the last games. We created more chances. Before the penalty we had three or four clear chances. After the second and third goal it was easy in the second half.\n\n\"It's important to win away but it's not easy. I'd like to involve the fans and make them believe we are good. We are the good guys - we run a lot and fight.\"\n\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"The penalty was the turning point because we looked good until then. It was maybe a soft one.\n\n\"We had a great chance to equalise but we didn't. We made mistakes after the goal and started to chase the ball. Quickly it was 3-0 and game over.\n\n\"It's a very bad day for us. It wasn't good enough.\n\n\"What disappointed me the most is that we started to chase them all over the pitch and then conceded two more and it was all over.\"\n\u2022 None The Hammers suffered their worst home defeat in FA Cup history, having never previously lost by a five-goal margin\n\u2022 None Only once have West Ham suffered a bigger FA Cup defeat - 6-0 against Manchester United in January 2003\n\u2022 None Sergio Aguero has been involved in 12 goals in 11 FA Cup appearances for Manchester City (10 goals, two assists)\n\u2022 None West Ham have shipped three or more goals in a game on eight occasions this season - twice as many as they did in the whole of 2015-16\n\u2022 None John Stones scored his first club goal since April 2015 (for Everton against Manchester United in the Premier League)\n\nBack to the Premier League for both clubs next weekend.\n\nWest Ham, who are 13th in the top flight, host London rivals Crystal Palace on Saturday (15:00 GMT), while fourth-placed City go to Everton on Sunday (13:30 GMT).\n\u2022 None Delay over. They are ready to continue.\n\u2022 None Attempt blocked. Nolito (Manchester City) right footed shot from the centre of the box is blocked.\n\u2022 None Attempt saved.
