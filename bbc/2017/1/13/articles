            "description": "Talented photographer and campaigner for the disabled whose marriage to Princess Margaret captivated the media.",
            "section": "UK",
            "content": "Lord Snowdon was a talented film maker and photographer whose marriage to Princess Margaret fed the gossip columns for over a decade.\n\nHis career was punctuated by lurid tales of extra-marital affairs, alcohol and drugs, but throughout it all he maintained a close contact with the Royal Family.\n\nHis body of photographic work featured the cream of British society, although he was usually dismissive about his work.\n\nHe was most proud of the stunning aviary he helped design for London Zoo.\n\nHe was born Anthony Charles Robert Armstrong-Jones on 7 March 1930, into a family of minor gentry.\n\nHis father, Ronald, was a barrister while his mother, society beauty Anne Messel, later became Countess of Rosse, following her divorce from his father.\n\nIn his teens, he contracted polio and had to lie flat on his back for a year. It left him with a permanent limp.\n\nBut visits by such luminaries as Noel Coward and Marlene Dietrich, arranged by his uncle, the theatre designer Oliver Messel, helped alleviate the boredom.\n\nThe start of what was to prove a stormy marriage\n\nHe was educated at Eton, where his passion for photography began. He went on to Jesus College, Cambridge, and was cox of the victorious eight in the 1950 Boat Race.\n\nHe never completed his course on architecture, and at 21 took up photography as a career, setting up a studio of his own in London.\n\nIt was his flair for taking less formal photographs that earned him the commission, in 1956, for the 21st birthday pictures of the Duke of Kent.\n\nLater he was invited to Buckingham Palace to photograph the Prince of Wales and other members of the Royal Family, including Princess Margaret.\n\nUnlike some photographers, he did not set out to create a rapport with his subjects.\n\n\"I don't want people to feel at ease,\" he once said. \"You want a bit of an edge.\"\n\nHis engagement to Princess Margaret was announced in 1960.\n\nAt the time there had been no recent precedent for anyone so near to the throne marrying outside the ranks of royalty or the British peerage.\n\nThe wedding took place on 6 May 1960, and after a honeymoon tour of the Caribbean in the royal yacht Britannia, the young couple moved into Kensington Palace.\n\nEarly in 1961 Armstrong-Jones was raised to the peerage as Lord Snowdon, and he took his seat in the House of Lords a year later. A son, David, Viscount Linley, was born in 1961, and their daughter, Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones, three years later.\n\nIn 1963 the Queen made him Constable of Caernarvon Castle, and as such he took a leading part in the arrangements for the investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969.\n\nHe was scathing about the ceremonial surrounding the event, claiming that most of the procedures used were \"completely bogus\".\n\nPrincess Margaret and Lord Snowdon went to Jamaica together in 1962, when the princess represented the Queen at the independence celebrations, and they made an official visit to the United States in 1964.\n\nIn the early years of their marriage, he and Princess Margaret were treated almost as Hollywood stars. The press relished incidents in which the Snowdons donned leather jackets and raced motorbikes along London's North Circular Road.\n\nThey consorted with celebrities of the day, and provided a marked contrast to the more conservative Queen and Prince Philip.\n\nBut the marriage quickly experienced the sort of difficulties that were destined to plague royal relationships over the following 20 years.\n\nHe had a flair for informal photography\n\nSnowdon's womanising was part of the reason for the break-up. A natural charmer, he had a string of relationships throughout his life and seemed incapable of remaining faithful.\n\nOne close friend was quoted in a biography of the earl as saying: \"If it moves, he'll have it.\"\n\nMargaret's own predilection for late-night partying, and the desire of both of them to be the centre of attention, also fuelled the breakdown.\n\nBy then, Snowdon had embarked on a varied professional career - acting as adviser to the Council of Industrial Design, and working for various publications, including the Sunday Times.\n\nThe aviary he helped design for London Zoo opened in 1964. It was regarded as cutting-edge in its use of new materials, providing the maximum amount of space for birds to fly.\n\nHe helped to make several television documentaries. The first, Don't Count the Candles, from 1968, was about old age and won seven international awards.\n\nIn 1975 he directed two programmes in BBC television's Explorers series, and in 1981 he presented two programmes on photography, Snowdon on Camera, for which he was nominated for a Bafta Award.\n\nThe aviary at London zoo was regarded as a triumph of design\n\nIt was during a debate on the mobility of people with physical disabilities that he had made his maiden speech in the Lords in April 1974.\n\nIn March 1976, it was finally announced that he and Princess Margaret would live apart.\n\nWhen Margaret had a relationship with Roddy Llewellyn, Snowdon was able to play the part, though not very convincingly, of the cuckolded husband, and the divorce became final in 1978.\n\nSnowdon always refused to speak about the marriage but he regularly saw the children and continued to photograph the Royal Family.\n\nIn December 1978, he was married again, to Lucy Lindsay-Hogg, a researcher on a BBC television series on which he was working. They had a daughter, Frances, the following July.\n\nIn June 1980 Snowdon started an award scheme for disabled students. The money for it came from the reproduction fees he had received over 20 years from his royal photographs.\n\nThe following year the Snowdon Council was formed, of which he was president. It comprised 12 members co-ordinating a dozen different bodies concerned with helping disabled people.\n\nAlso in 1981 a compromise was reached in his long-running row with Lord Aberconway, president of the Royal Horticultural Society, who had said that disabled visitors to the Chelsea Flower Show were not encouraged.\n\nHis subjects were often the rich and famous\n\nIt was agreed that guide dogs would be admitted, and a special garden was created for those with disabilities.\n\nWhile married to Lucy Lindsay-Hogg, Snowdon had a long affair with journalist Ann Hills, who took her own life in 1996.\n\nTwo years later, at the age of 68, he fathered a son, Jasper, with 33-year-old Melanie Cable-Alexander, a journalist on Country Life.\n\nThis proved the final straw for Lucy, and the couple divorced.\n\nBy then Snowdon had lost his seat in the Lords, following Labour's clear-out of hereditary peers. Instead, he took a life peerage as Baron Armstrong-Jones to enable him to remain in the House.\n\nDespite an increasing disability as a result of his childhood polio, Lord Snowdon travelled widely, doing work for the theatre and fashion houses as well as portraits and travelogues.\n\nA friend once said of him, \"It's impossible to imagine a gentler, more cultured man.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "description": "For decades Antarctica hosted only the simplest huts as human shelters - but architecture in the coldest, driest, windiest continent is getting snazzier.",
            "section": "Magazine",
            "content": "How do you build in the most isolated place on Earth? For decades Antarctica - the only continent with no indigenous population - hosted only the simplest huts as human shelters. But, as Matthew Teller finds out, architecture in the coldest, driest, windiest reaches of our planet is getting snazzier.\n\nIt's an eye-popping, futuristic design - a dark, sleek building, low and long, that is destined to be a temporary waterfront home for up to 65 people at a time.\n\nThe price tag is a hefty $100m (\u00a380m). And while a Chinese company is building it, it's not in China, and almost no-one will ever see it.\n\nAfter the original burned down in 2012, the Brazilian navy launched an architectural competition for a replacement design - won by a local firm - and then awarded the building tender to a Chinese defence and engineering contractor, CEIEC. It's due to be completed in 2018.\n\nThe upper block will contain cabins, dining and living space; the lower block will house laboratories and operational areas\n\nLocated on a small island just off the coast of Antarctica, it lies almost 1,000km (600 miles) south of the tip of South America. No scheduled air routes come close and it's way off any shipping lanes.\n\nAnd even if you could reach it yourself, like all Antarctic research stations Comandante Ferraz will be closed to the public. Virtually nobody other than the crews posted there will ever see it in the flesh. So why, you may ask, spend so much on architectural style? Wouldn't a dull but functional building do just as well?\n\nBrazil is not alone in paying for eye-catching design, though.\n\nIn 2013, India unveiled its Bharati station, with a similar modernist design.\n\nDesigned by bof arkitekten, Bharati overlooks the sea and is used to study polar marine life\n\nIt was made from 134 prefabricated shipping containers, for ease of transport and construction, but you would never guess it from the outside.\n\nAnd the following year, South Korea opened its Jang Bogo station - a grand, triple-winged module lifted on steel-reinforced blocks, capable of supporting a crew of 60.\n\nJang Bogo's aerodynamic triple-arm design is said to provide resistance to the elements\n\nWhat is the explanation for this architectural flamboyance?\n\n\"Antarctic stations have become the equivalent of embassies on the ice,\" says Prof Anne-Marie Brady, editor-in-chief of the Polar Journal and author of China as a Polar Great Power.\n\n\"They are showcases for a nation's interests in Antarctica - status symbols.\"\n\nThose interests could be purely scientific. But a moratorium on mineral prospecting becomes easier to review in just over 40 years' time, and every Antarctic player also wants to be ready to take advantage, should anything change.\n\nPlanting a dramatic building on the ice has become the modern equivalent of explorers of old planting a flag.\n\nIt wasn't always like this.\n\nIn March 1903, the 33 men of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition landed on the outlying South Orkney Islands and built a dry-stone shack.\n\nExpedition leader William Bruce grandly named it Omond House, after the Edinburgh meteorologist, Robert Traill Omond. It was Antarctica's first permanent building, and is maintained today by the Argentine government as part of its Orcadas base.\n\nFor years afterwards, throughout the heroic age of polar exploration headed by Amundsen, Scott, Shackleton and Mawson, nothing much fancier than wooden huts went up on the white continent.\n\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry visited Shackleton's hut in November\n\nThen came a - relative - building boom, spurred by the International Geophysical Year (IGY) of 1957-58, a global project for co-operation in science. The 1959 Antarctic Treaty, which resulted from the IGY, suspended all territorial claims, but that led many countries to set about consolidating their presence in other ways, such as construction.\n\nThe treaty's clause giving countries conducting \"substantial research activity\" in Antarctica a vote in meetings to determine the continent's future was another incentive to maintain a physical presence.\n\nThe US's sprawling McMurdo research station dates from this period. Powered from 1962 to 1972 by a nuclear reactor, it is the biggest settlement on the continent, housing a summer population of about 1,200.\n\nThe McMurdo station has a harbour, landing strips on sea ice and shelf ice, and a helicopter pad\n\nThe McMurdo coffee house serves hot drinks to workers and is attached to a small cinema - the chapel of the snows, a non-denominational Christian church, is nearby\n\nFor years, though, what with the huge technical and logistical difficulties in building anything in Antarctica, architectural glamour stayed off the list of priorities.\n\nThe UK's Halley station was just \"a few wooden huts inside giant steel tubes\" when meteorologist Peter Gibbs arrived in 1980. It lay buried beneath 15m (50ft) of snow.\n\n\"It was like living in a submarine, clambering up and down ladders to get in and out,\" Gibbs remembers.\n\nBuilt in 1973, Halley III was abandoned in 1983 because of access and ventilation problems\n\nAntarctica as a whole has so little precipitation it is classified as a desert, but snow does fall near the coasts, and in the interior low temperatures mean fallen snow accumulates faster than it can melt. Polar winds blow this snow around the continent, so that any object standing proud of the flat surface quickly gains a downwind \"tail\" of blown snow. Snow accumulation can swamp and crush buildings with ease.\n\nThe first Halley station, built in 1956, was abandoned 12 years later, when it too had become \"like a submarine\", as Gibbs puts it.\n\nThe version he worked in, Halley III, was built in 1973 and lasted only 10 years. Until Halley VI arrived in 2013, all were defeated by snow accumulation, and by the moving ice shelf on which they stood. At Halley's location the ice slides around 1.5m (5ft) a day towards the sea, but to maintain accuracy the station's scientific measurements have to be made at the same place year by year.\n\nDesigned by Hugh Broughton Architects and Aecom, Halley VI's red module contains the communal areas\n\nHalley VI, however, is Antarctica's first relocatable research station. Its eight connected pods - like giant, colourful train carriages, which can be isolated to limit the spread of fire - sit on hydraulic legs mounted on huge, 8m-long skis. This means that the pods can be detached from each other, dragged by bulldozers to a new location, and the whole station reassembled.\n\nThat design is being put to good use, as Halley is currently being moved to avoid a chasm that is opening up in the ice nearby.\n\nAnd Halley VI is both glamorous and comfortable.\n\nUnlike earlier Halley stations, each bedroom now has a window to the outside\n\nIts bijou bedrooms feel like a classy budget hotel. Interiors are fitted in vivid reds, blues and greens to compensate for the lack of colour outside. Halley's pool table and sofas sit beneath the only double-height internal space in Antarctica, stylishly lit - outside the months of winter darkness, anyway - by tall, semi-opaque windows. Beside the drinks bar climbs a spiral staircase, clad in aromatic Lebanese cedar veneer, chosen to stimulate an often-overlooked sense in the almost completely smell-free Antarctic environment.\n\n\"All the newest bases look good as well as do the science - it's a reflection of the priorities of our era,\" says Anne-Marie Brady.\n\nSouth Africa was one of the first countries to solve the problem of snow accumulation with its SANAE IV base, which opened in 1997. It was designed with stilt-like legs, which let snow blow under the building.\n\nGermany applied the same concept to its Neumayer III base, which opened in 2009, with an extra refinement. Sixteen hydraulic pillars allow the entire two-storey structure to be raised every year by around a metre. The foot of each pillar is then lifted and replaced on a new firm base of packed snow.\n\nNeumayer III always stands 6m above the ice - up to 50 people live there during the summer and nine in the winter\n\nLike the UK's Halley base, Concordia, an Italian and French research facility is used by the European Space Agency to study the physical and psychological effects of isolation - the nearest people are stationed 600 km (370 miles) away\n\nAnother element of Antarctic architecture that has become critical is energy efficiency. Most stations run on polar diesel, which is expensive, polluting and difficult to transport. Belgium's Princess Elisabeth station, an aerodynamic pod raised on steel legs, is the first with zero emissions.\n\nSince its inauguration in 2009 it has run entirely on solar and wind energy, and - even here - has no heating. The station's layered design means interior temperatures are maintained from waste heat generated by electrical systems and human activity, and dense wall insulation reduces heat loss to almost zero.\n\nThe Princess Elisabeth station has nine wind turbines\n\nPhotovoltaic solar panels also provide electricity, while thermal solar panels melt snow and heat water for bathrooms and kitchens\n\nIf the Princess Elisabeth station looks like something out of a Bond movie, China's latest Antarctic station Taishan - its fourth - has been likened to a flying saucer. It was rush-built in 45 days in 2013-14, and is intended to last only a few years.\n\nA model of the Taishan research centre - China's fourth in Antarctica\n\n\"China will probably start building a fifth station this year,\" says Anne-Marie Brady.\n\nLike all the rest, few people will ever see it.\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.",

            "description": "South Korea has brought its gender gap back into balance, but have women gained real equality?",
            "section": "Asia",
            "content": "Daughters were traditionally valued less than sons in South Korea\n\nFor every 100 baby girls born in India, there are 111 baby boys. In China, the ratio is 100 to 115. One other country saw similar rates in 1990, but has since brought its population back into balance. How did South Korea do it? Yvette Tan reports.\n\n\"One daughter is equal to 10 sons,\" was the message desperately being promoted by the South Korean government.\n\nIt was some two decades ago and gender imbalance was at a high, reaching 116.5 boys for every 100 girls at its peak. The preference for sons goes back centuries in Korean tradition. They were seen to carry on the family line, provide financial support and take care of their parents in old age.\n\n\"There was the idea that daughters were not regarded as part of their own family after marriage,\" says Ms Park-Cha Okkyung, the executive director of the Korean Women's Associations United.\n\nThe government was looking for a solution - and fast.\n\nIn an effort to reduce the incidence of selective abortions, South Korea enacted a law in 1988 making it illegal for a doctor to reveal the gender of a foetus to expectant parents.\n\nAt the same time women were also becoming more educated, with many more starting to join the workforce, challenging the convention that it was the job of a man to provide for his family.\n\nIt worked, but it was not for one reason alone. Rather, a combination of these factors led to the eventual gender rebalancing.\n\nSouth Korea was acknowledged as the \"first Asian country to reverse the trend in rising sex ratios at birth\", in a report by the World Bank.\n\nIn 2013, the ratio was down to 105.3, a number comparable to major Western nations such as Canada.\n\nMonica Das Gupta, research professor in sociology at the University of Maryland who has studied gender disparity across Asia, says factors other than legislation are likely to be the most significant in accounting for this change.\n\nA legal ban can \"dampen things a bit\", but she points out that \"seven years after the law [was instituted] sex-selective abortions continued\".\n\nRather she attributes the change to the \"blistering pace\" of urbanisation and industrialisation in South Korea.\n\nWhile the country was predominantly a rural society there was great emphasis on male lineage and boys staying at home to inherit their fathers' land.\n\nBut in just a few decades a large part of the population has moved to living in apartment blocks with people they don't know and working in factories with people they don't know, and the system has become much more impersonal, Dr Das Gupta says.\n\nChina and India, though, still have a stark gender imbalance, despite India outlawing, and China regulating against, sex-selective testing and abortions. So why is that?\n\nDr Das Gupta believes that in China this may be because until last year, the rule that your household registration - known as the hukou system - remained in the village where you were from, regardless of the fact that you might work in the city, meant that there was still an emphasis on male lineage and land ownership, but that this should now start to shift.\n\nBut she also stressed that the change is not always linear. As people gain economic advantage they have better access to sex-selective testing and have fewer children, which actually then puts greater emphasis on their gender.\n\nIn India in 1961, there were 976 girls for every 1,000 boys under the age of seven. According to the latest census figures released in 2011, that figure had dropped to a dismal 914 and campaigners say the decline is largely due to the increased availability of antenatal sex screening, despite the fact that both the tests and sex-selective abortion have been outlawed since 1994. They say that in the past decade alone, 8 million female foetuses may have been aborted in the country.\n\nBut she argues that several factors in India are slowly having a trickle-down effect on attitudes to women including media representation of women functioning in the outside world, and legislative changes enforcing equal inheritance rules and requiring one-third of elected positions be reserved for women.\n\nBBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year. We create documentaries, features and interviews about their lives, giving more space for stories that put women at the centre.\n\nOther stories you might like:\n\nWhile South Korea may have rebalanced its population, this does not necessarily equate gender equality, Ms Okkyung argues.\n\n\"Even though Korea has a normal gender ratio balance, discrimination against women still continues,\" the 47-year-old says. \"We need to pay more attention to the real situations that women face rather than just looking at the numbers.\"\n\nWomen in South Korea face one of the largest gender wage gaps amongst developed countries - at 36% in 2013. By comparison, New Zealand has a gap of some 5%.\n\n\"Nowadays women go to university at a higher rate than men in South Korea. However, the problem starts when women enter into the labour market,\" Ms Okkyung explains.\n\nWomen are still expected to manage both work and family in South Korea\n\n\"The glass ceiling is very solid and there is a low percentage of women at higher positions in offices.\"\n\nOne of the reasons it is harder for women to compete in the workplace is because they are expected to devote their time to both work and family.\n\n\"One example is that working mothers have a dilemma, as children in elementary schools come home early after lunch. Therefore, mothers who cannot see a sustainable future in the workplace tend to quit their jobs,\" says Ms Okkyung.\n\nDr Hyekung Lee was one of the few Korean women in her generation that did find workplace success.\n\n\"I have been very lucky that I was brought up in a very enlightened family. My family had three girls and two boys, and all were given the same support for education,\" says 68-year-old Dr Lee, who is the chairperson of the Korea Foundation for Women, the country's only non-profit organisation for women.\n\n\"But when I became a full-time faculty member in my university, I had to be the only woman professor in my department throughout my 30 years there.\"\n\nGenerally, attitudes towards women have improved as today's Korean men become more educated and exposed to global norms.\n\nThey also inevitably mix with women across all spheres of life, in workplaces, schools or social circles, something that perhaps was not so common decades ago.\n\nHaving children makes it hard for women to compete in the workplace, partly because of school hours for younger children\n\nIt is amongst the older generation that many still cling on to the preference for sons.\n\nEmily [not her real name], 26, recalls that growing up as an only child, she was always treated equally by her grandparents - until her step-brothers were born.\n\n\"I only noticed the difference when my brothers came,\" she said. \"Then I realised that they would never do stuff like the housework.\"\n\n\"My birthday is also one day before my father's so my grandparents didn't allow me to celebrate it because as they said: 'How dare a girl celebrate a birthday before her father?'\"\n\nHow long will South Korea's women take to catch up?\n\n\"I think Korea is at that transitional phase that people are more aware now than previous generations, but it's still not quite equal compared to Western countries,\" she says.\n\n\"I've had friends tell me I can only keep my career if I stay single, and others tell me I've chased away men because I was too bossy on the dates and took the initiative.\"\n\nShe also notes that there is also a substantial difference in attitudes towards women in bigger cities and smaller towns.\n\n\"Cities like Busan are more traditional. I've had friends from Busan get a culture shock when they come to Seoul,\" she says. \"In the capital, things are more progressive.\"\n\nYet she believes change will come.\n\n\"Women in Korea need to be aware that there is gender discrimination,\" says Emily, who is now studying in the Netherlands. \"I didn't know until I left - I thought the way things were was just how they were.\"\n\n\"It's not until you expose yourself to other cultures that you start to question your own. I think things will change, but it will take a lot of time.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by the BBC's Geeta Pandey and Yuwen Wu.",

It says Britain now finds itself caught in the crossfire of accusations between Russia and the US.\n\nThe Mail says Russia's relations with Britain have gone into the deep freeze as Moscow blamed MI6 for the dossier. The paper quotes a tweet from the Russian embassy in London suggesting Mr Steele was still working for MI6 and \"briefing both ways\" against Mr Trump and Moscow.\n\nThe Mirror's front page has a picture of a two-year-old boy lying on two chairs put together as a makeshift bed at a hospital in Hastings in East Sussex due to a lack of proper beds.\n\nIt says Jack Harwood - who had suspected meningitis - waited for five hours in A&E with his mother, as staff struggled to cope with the volume of patients. His case was put to Theresa May by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.\n\nThe boy was eventually sent home after his temperature was brought down and his relieved parents were told he didn't have meningitis.\n\nThe new King of Rwanda has been proclaimed - and he lives in a terrace house on an estate in Greater Manchester.\n\nThe Guardian says it's not a typical royal residence - but the Rwandan royal family has been exiled since 1961.\n\nThe Daily Mail says Emmanuel Bushayija is thought to be the first Briton to accede as a king since George the Sixth inherited the throne following the abdication crisis in 1936. It seems Mr Bushayija has been keeping a low profile since his elevation, but neighbours tell the paper he's a lovely man and it's a great honour to live next to him.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, the Sun portrayed Graham Taylor - then England football manager - as a turnip after the national team were knocked out during the group stages of Euro 92.\n\nFollowing his death - announced yesterday - it pays tribute to him in its leader column. While it acknowledges his failings as manager, it highlights his successes at club level, describing him as a genius. He had a magnificent football brain and made a fine radio pundit, it adds. Above all - it goes on - he was just a thoroughly decent bloke.\n\nFinally, you could save yourself as much as nine thousand pounds on a house purchase - if you don't mind living at number 13. Research by the property website, Zoopla - released to coincide with today's date, Friday the 13th - found that nearly a third of homebuyers are less likely to buy a property with this number.\n\nBut - the Mail reports - those who are not put off by it will find a house with this number typically cheaper than the average UK property. On the other hand, the most expensive door number tends to be number one - and Number 100 the next most expensive.",

            "description": "One woman's story of why confronting India's 'Eve teasers' is not always straightforward.",
            "section": "BBC Trending",
            "content": "Samya Gupta, a 21-year-old law student from the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, was napping on a seat near the back of a bus when she felt something on her breasts.\n\nIt was the hands of a man sitting in the row behind her.\n\n\"The moment I realised (what was happening), I stood up from my seat, yelled and asked for his ID proof,\" Gupta wrote in a widely-shared Facebook post.\n\nShe went on to detail how she not only confronted her alleged molester, but got the bus to take a detour so he could be taken into police custody.\n\nGupta ended her account with a series of hashtags including #TooHorrifiedToLetItGo. But the social media users who have expressed admiration for Gupta's stand, may be disappointed by what has happened since.\n\nIn her post Gupta wrote that when she challenged the man, who she says was in his 40s, he apologised. There were around 30 other passengers on the bus and they reportedly vocalised their support for Gupta. But they also advised her to not pursue the matter, she said.\n\n\"My co-passengers asked me to accept it, and let it go,\" Gupta wrote, \"But I decided otherwise. I decided to not let it go. I decided to not let an audacious eve-teaser to go free merely by apologising.\"\n\nIn her post she said that she chose to speak up because she didn't want the alleged aggressor to feel confident enough in the future to escalate his behaviour to a more violent assault - \"to convert into a rapist\".\n\n\"Eve teasing\" is a common term used in some South Asian countries to refer to a wide variety of behaviour including molestation. According to Sameera Khan, the co-author of 'Why Loiter? Women & Risk on Mumbai Streets' it includes \"flashing or any verbal/physical sexual street harassment that falls short of rape.\"\n\n\"It's an archaic term,\" says Khan, \"The 'Eve' part comes from the Old Testament and describing harassment as 'teasing' makes it sound almost like a mild romantic overture that should be tolerated - which of course it should not.\"\n\nGupta told BBC Trending that she persuaded the bus driver to divert the bus to the nearest local police station. The passengers, who had surrounded the man who had allegedly been groping Gupta, then escorted them both into the building. There Gupta filed a harassment complaint against the man whose name has not emerged in the media and was not named in Gupta's post.\n\n\"The process of filing a complaint was lengthy and laborious,\" Gupta added.\n\nShe says that she was informed she would have to provide her statement in Hindi, a language she says she doesn't know to write well.\n\n\"This made me wonder what happens to illiterate women in India who muster up the courage to go to the police,\" she told Trending, \"I'm a law student and even I found the process tedious and challenging.\"\n\nGupta wrote in her Facebook post that her problems didn't end when she left the police station. She claimed that when she took another bus several acquaintances of the alleged harasser approached her and told her to drop her complaint. She added that they questioned her character, accusing her of \"goofing around with various guys every now and then, therefore my allegations have no sense of veracity\".\n\nA court date was set for a hearing for the harassment charge. But before it arrived Gupta withdrew her charge.\n\nSpeaking to Trending, she cited a couple of reasons for dropping the case.\n\nOne, she said, was due to \"complacency with paperwork\" which she claimed resulted in her mobile number becoming available to man's family. As a result, Gupta told Trending, she received calls pressuring her to drop the case because the accused man was a father of two.\n\nSimilarly, she said, her own family also advised her to drop the case.\n\n\"They felt Eve teasing wasn't serious enough an incident to merit going through with a court trial,\" Gupta told Trending.\n\nShe added: \"I am a student and I don't earn my own money. I come a family with no background with the law. Going to the police station was a big deal for them. I dropped the charge because it seemed like too much pressure on my family.\"\n\nLocal police have defended the handling of the case. Inspector Shiv Mangal Singh told BBC Trending that officers had followed protocol.\n\n\"Then the girl, Samya Gupta and her father, came to the police station and told us to drop the case. In terms of the accuser's family getting her phone number, that didn't happen at our end, it may be an administration issue with the lawyers. Similarly, they were people available to translate and write the document in Hindi for her.\"\n\nInspector Singh said that even after the case had been dropped, the man still spent several more days in custody, because the statute under which he was arrested requires suspects to remain in custody for 14 days without the prospect of bail.\n\nHe added: \"We take Eve-teasing seriously and have set up a Whatsapp number where women can send complaints about Eve-teasing.\"\n\nEve-teasing, is not specifically classified as an offence specific in Indian law. However sections of the Indian Penal code are said to cover offences comprising sexually intimidating behaviour. This includes Section 354 which is defined as \"assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty\" and Section 509 which allows for up to three years imprisonment for on \"word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman.\"\n\nA shocking, graphic video showing torture and racial abuse led far-right activists to link the perpetrators to the Black Lives Matter movement.

            "section": "The Papers",
            "content": "Theresa May's plan to make GPs in England open their surgeries seven days a week features on several of Saturday's front pages.\n\nThe Daily Mail says the \"personal intervention\" by the prime minister comes as \"thousands\" of surgeries close early on weekday afternoons, \"while others take a three-hour lunch break\".\n\nAccording to the Daily Telegraph, access to a major package of government funding will be \"contingent\" on GPs being able to demonstrate they are offering appointments when patients want them.\n\nThe Times warns that many GPs \"are likely to be incensed\" by the plan, after years of claiming there are too few of them to cope with an ageing population.\n\nThe Conservative chair of the Commons Health Select Committee has said the Tories \"risk losing the trust of voters\" on the NHS in an interview with the newspaper.\n\nDr Sarah Wollaston, who was a GP before entering parliament, says the system is \"underfunded\", and warns that \"relentless\" pressures on staff are contributing to what she describes as a \"human crisis\".\n\nShe denies that GPs are lazy, claiming she has never encountered one who plays golf during the day, and instead argues that the key to dealing with problems in the NHS is to increase funding for social care.\n\nThe Guardian reports that Michel Barnier is \"backing away from his hardline approach\" to Brexit\n\nThe lead story in the Guardian details how the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said he wants a \"special\" relationship with the City of London to continue to give EU countries easy access to the financial centre after Britain leaves.\n\nThe paper says it has seen unpublished minutes that hint at \"unease\" about the costs of Brexit on the rest of the EU, and give the \"first signs\" that Mr Barnier is \"backing away from his hardline approach\".\n\nThe European Commission has insisted the minutes \"do not correctly reflect\" what was said, but a source has described them to the Guardian as \"more or less accurate\".\n\nTristram Hunt's decision to quit as the Labour MP for Stoke Central is widely seen as bad news for Jeremy Corbyn in Saturday's newspapers.\n\nThe Daily Express claims Labour will need a \"miracle\" to retain the seat in a by-election.\n\nFor the Times, the resignation underlines Labour's \"poor leadership and dearth of talent\", while the Sun believes life is \"too short\" to spend a decade in \"impotent opposition\".\n\nOnly the Daily Mail is critical of Mr Hunt, arguing that his new job as director of the Victoria and Albert Museum means he joins \"multitudes of like-thinking left-wing luvvies\" running \"almost every public body in the country\".\n\nLord Snowdon features on several front pages following his death aged 86\n\nPhotographs of Lord Snowdon are printed on several front pages, including the Daily Express which claims the Queen has been \"left saddened\" by the death of her former brother-in-law at the age of 86.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph notes that he was seen as \"one of the country's foremost photographers, but became known for his many affairs\", a fact which prompts The Sun to describe him as \"the romping rock'n'roll royal rebel\".\n\nThe Daily Mirror highlights some of his \"iconic\" images, including photographs of David Bowie and Sir Richard Branson, and praises his portraits of the royal family for capturing \"a more human side\".",

            "description": "The market for fitness trackers seems to be booming, but are these gadgets actually effective?",
            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Keen cyclist Peter Dumbreck uses fitness trackers to improve his performance\n\nFitness-tracking devices have helped Peter Dumbreck beat his personal best times for cycling three days in a row.\n\nThe racing driver and keen cyclist uses a Garmin 810 Edge cycle computer, a heart rate monitor and a power meter.\n\n\"The power meter is embedded into my left crank arm and talks via Bluetooth to my Garmin device, as does my heart rate monitor,\" he says.\n\n\"I can see my power [the force his legs are generating], which is updated every three seconds, on my Garmin screen and through training and experience know how many watts I can maintain and for how long I can do it,\" he says.\n\nWearable and portable fitness trackers are certainly helping serious athletes like Peter to push themselves to the limit.\n\nBut what about the rest of us? Does knowing how many calories we're burning, how fast our hearts are beating, and how many steps we've taken really motivate us to do more exercise and eat more healthily?\n\nIn short, do they really work?\n\n\"They've made us all aware of how we treat our bodies, and they have even helped people diagnose things like diabetes and obesity,\" says Collette Johnson, head of marketing at design technology consultancy Plextek.\n\n\"But I feel they could go further.\"\n\nLast year the University of Pittsburgh concluded that fitness trackers were \"ineffective at sustaining weight loss\".\n\nThe two-year study, conducted by the university's School of Education Department of Health and Physical Activity, involved 500 overweight volunteers. All were asked to diet and engage in more exercise, but only half were given a fitness tracker to help them.\n\nDo fitness trackers make us more or less motivated?\n\nThe study found that the group wearing trackers lost 8lb (3.6kg), but the ones who didn't lost 13lb (5.9kg).\n\n\"Trackers are a reliable measurement of our activity, but we can't rely on them completely,\" says Andrew Lane, professor of sport psychology at the University of Wolverhampton.\n\n\"We can't expect just to buy one and that's it - some of the responsibility sits with us too. We still have to get off that sofa and complete those 10,000 steps a day.\"\n\nProf Lane believes that, if used inappropriately, they may even start to have a negative psychological effect.\n\n\"What if we start consistently not reaching goals set for us by them? Ultimately it would lead to us feeling demotivated - the opposite effect they are supposed to have.\"\n\nSuch concerns haven't stopped the market from booming - yet.\n\nLeading wearable fitness tracker maker Fitbit reported 2015 revenues of \u00a31.3bn, while researcher CSS Insight forecasts that the market will be worth \u00a316bn by 2020.\n\nAnd the fact that smartwatch sales declined sharply last year, according to market analysts IDC, has led many makers to reposition them primarily as fitness-tracking devices - another indication of where the business potential lies.\n\nBut is the problem with them that they are neither accurate nor sophisticated enough yet?\n\n\"As well as providing data for us, companies need to provide coaching with this data. They need to take responsibility for the results they're providing us,\" says Prof Lane.\n\nPlextek's Collette Johnson thinks trackers need to give us more tailored advice\n\nAnd Plextek's Ms Johnson thinks they need to understand more about the individual user.\n\n\"They need to recognise whether Sharon from Uxbridge really should be doing two hours of fitness a week, how that's going to impact upon her body, her joints, whether she's at risk of osteoporosis.\n\n\"Fitness trackers can be too generic, personalising them will motivate us more,\" she tells the BBC.\n\nApps, like the Slimming World app, may be better for achieving sustained weight loss, she argues, because they allow you to track your weight loss progress and give you incentives after it has recorded your exercise.\n\n\"There is no doubt the industry is booming, but for it to really see results it needs not only to give us results, but to make them as personalised and as accurate as possible.\"\n\nSo what tech innovations are making fitness tracking more effective?\n\nGenetics and nutrition firm DNAFit advises on how we should be training and what we should be eating after testing our genes and applying its algorithm to the analysis.\n\nYou take a saliva swab and send it off to the company's lab. After 10 days a report tells you which exercises your body will respond to best and which foods you should be eating. The company says its technology platform has been peer reviewed and clinically tested.\n\nAndrew Steele, DNAFit's head of product, shows how to take a saliva swab for DNA testing\n\nOther companies such as FitnessGenes, Genetrainer and AnabolicGenes adopt similar approaches.\n\nJo Rooney, 35, a deputy headteacher, used the test to try to cure her stomach problems.\n\n\"My results came back quite quickly and told me that I was actually lactose intolerant and had a high sensitivity to gluten.\n\n\"This did mean quite a radical change to my diet, and a lot more forward planning, but within a week I felt a lot less bloated, lost weight and I'd stopped having stomach problems.\"\n\nBody scanners and tech built into sports clothes are also giving us more detailed results.\n\nFor example, Fit3D uses scanners to assess the whole body to calculate body fat percentage, assess posture and give body shape scoring.\n\nWhile last year, OMsignal launched OMbra, a smart sports bra that tracks heart rate, breathing and distance between steps, and shares this data with a smartphone app.\n\nThe OMbra is a wearable fitness tracker that's really wearable\n\nProf Lane believes that we're also going to start seeing biometric devices integrated not just into clothes and wearable devices, but directly on to our bodies as well.\n\nFor example, US tech firm Chaotic Moon Studios - now called Fjord - has created a prototype tech tattoo - a skin-mounted monitor that connects to your smartphone to monitor heart rate, blood pressure and even track movement via GPS.\n\nNow we just need an injection of willpower.",
