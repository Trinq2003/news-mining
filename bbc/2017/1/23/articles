            "content": "The appearance of fake news on websites and social media has inspired scientists to develop a \"vaccine\" to immunise people against the problem.\n\nResearchers suggest \"pre-emptively exposing\" readers to a small \"dose\" of the misinformation can help organisations cancel out bogus claims.\n\nStories on the US election and Syria are among those to have caused concern.\n\n\"Misinformation can be sticky, spreading and replicating like a virus,\" said the University of Cambridge study's lead author Dr Sander van der Linden.\n\n\"The idea is to provide a cognitive repertoire that helps build up resistance to misinformation, so the next time people come across it they are less susceptible.\"\n\nThe study, published in the journal Global Challenges, was conducted as a disguised experiment.\n\nMore than 2,000 US residents were presented with two claims about global warming.\n\nThe researchers say when presented consecutively, the influence well-established facts had on people were cancelled out by bogus claims made by campaigners.\n\nBut when information was combined with misinformation, in the form of a warning, the fake news had less resonance.\n\nFabricated stories alleging the Pope was backing Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton sold weapons to the so-called Islamic State group were read and shared by millions of Facebook users during the US election campaign.\n\nThe world's largest social network later announced new features to help combat fabricated news stories, and there is pressure on Google and Twitter to do more to tackle the issue.\n\nMeanwhile, German officials have reportedly proposed creating a special government unit to combat fake news in the run-up to this year's general election, while a senior Labour MP only last week warned that British politics risks being \"infected by the contagion\".\n\nThe deliberate making up of news stories to fool or entertain is nothing new. But the arrival of social media has meant real and fictional stories are now presented in such a similar way that it can sometimes be difficult to tell the two apart.\n\nThere are hundreds of fake news websites out there, from those which deliberately imitate real life newspapers, to government propaganda sites, and even those which tread the line between satire and plain misinformation, sometimes employed to suit political ends.",

            "section": "The Papers",
            "content": "The revelation of a reported malfunction during the test firing of a Trident missile in June is widely covered in Monday's press.\n\nThe Daily Mail says it is likely the unarmed missile was made to crash harmlessly into the sea but the \"fiasco\" caused major panic in Downing Street.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May, reports the Times, will face intense pressure to answer charges of a cover-up after she refused to say whether she knew about the incident when questioned on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.\n\nThe Daily Mirror describes it as \"May's Missile crisis\", saying in a leading article the \"official news blackout only fans suspicions this was a serious failure\".\n\nThe Guardian, which leads with the story, says critics of Trident may now seize on the failure to argue that the debate about renewing the system should be reopened.\n\nSeveral papers report international trade will be one of the big issues when Theresa May meets Donald Trump on Friday.\n\nThe Times thinks it is a historic chance to make the case for genuine free trade, and an advantageous deal with Britain.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph says Mrs May and Mr Trump will hold talks over a deal that slashes tariffs and makes it easier for hundreds of thousands of workers to move between the two countries.\n\nKevin Maguire of the Daily Mirror thinks Mrs May is \"a fool\" for flitting over to America \"to be photographic cover for a divisive, lying, racist, sexual predator\".\n\nBut Trevor Kavanagh of the Sun says the \"world is a reality show... and Britain has woken up as one of the biggest stars\".\n\nHe sees opportunities, and dangers, and has this advice: \"Hold tight... We are in for the ride of our lives.\"\n\nElsewhere, Mrs May has penned an article for the i explaining her new industrial strategy.\n\nShe refers to seeking a brighter future after Brexit, and making Britain a country that works for everyone. And she invites \"the industries of the future\" to tell the government what they need in order to grow and prosper.\n\nThe lead story in the Sun refers to a Food Standards Agency warning of a link between burned starchy foods and cancer - that pizza, chips and toast \"are killers\".\n\nThe headline on the front of paper is stark: \"You've had your chips.\"\n\nBut not everyone is willing to agree.\n\nThe Daily Express asks: \"Do scientists actually want us to lead miserable lives?\" Alcohol, then sugar, fat, and now crispy roast potatoes. \"Why can't people be left to lead their own lives without others meddling?\"\n\nFew things, says the Daily Telegraph, bring families together on a cold winter's day like a Sunday roast. And the paper cannot be enthusiastic about boiled beef, with steamed vegetables but no Yorkshire pudding or wine.\n\nA cartoon in the Daily Mail shows an insolent boy smoking. His concerned mother says: \"And remember, if anyone offers you a crunchy roast potato at the party - you know what to say.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Guardian has reassurance for shoppers who have been unable to find lettuce, spinach, or courgettes on their supermarket shelves.\n\nVast amounts of rain in south-eastern Spain, then heavy snow, wiped out much of their crops. But now, the farmers of Murcia believe the worst is over, and normal production looks set to resume, it reports.\n\nFinally, the Daily Express says advisors to Margaret Thatcher were alarmed 30 years ago when she was asked to test drive a new Rover saloon outside Downing Street.\n\nPapers, made public from her archive, reveal their concern that, as the Daily Telegraph reports, she might crash in front of the cameras.\n\nThose fears proved groundless - she was allowed a practice at Chequers first. But the Sun cannot resist summing up their worries in a headline: \"The lady's not for three-point turning\".",

Others need urgent treatment.\n\nAny bits of bone that have been pressed inwards can be removed and returned to their correct position. If necessary, metal wire or mesh may be used to reconnect the pieces.\n\nOnce the bone is back in place, it should heal.\n\n'Lessons appear to have been learned'\n\nPeter McCabe, chief executive of brain injury association Headway, said the reaction of the medical teams was \"exemplary\".\n\nMcCabe, who was at Stamford Bridge, added: \"Headway has been critical of the way in which head injuries have been treated in many high-profile football incidents in recent years, but it is positive to see that lessons appear to have been learned.\"",

            "section": "India",
            "content": "Karan Johar is one of Bollywood's most influential directors\n\nBollywood director and talk show host Karan Johar's autobiography has kicked off a loud debate on being gay in India, writes Sudha G Tilak.\n\n\"Everybody knows what my sexual orientation is. I don't need to scream it out. If I need to spell it out, I won't only because I live in a country where I could possibly be jailed for saying this. Which is why I Karan Johar will not say the three words that possibly everybody knows about me,\" Johar says in the book.\n\nThe title of his memoir, An Unsuitable Boy, is a play on A Suitable Boy, the novel by award-winning Indian author Vikram Seth.\n\nSeth has publicly spoken up against a draconian Indian law that criminalises homosexuality. His mother, a former judge and writer, has also written about Seth being gay.\n\nIn an interview Seth had said that it was a \"sad dereliction of their responsibility\" when famous Indians refused to come out and be \"role models\" for many others who were suffering silently.\n\nHowever, Johar's memoir, co-authored with journalist Poonam Saxena, does not do that.\n\nAnd Bollywood's budding filmmakers, activists and Twitterati have come down on him saying he has only trivialised being gay in his films. They say his decision to hold back from explicitly coming out, and opting to leave \"bold clues\" about his sexuality instead, belittles their suffering.\n\nIt has never been easy to be openly gay in India\n\nIn response to the criticism Johar writes, \"The reason I don't say it out aloud is simply that I don't want to be dealing with the FIRs [police complaints]. I'm very sorry. I have a job, I have a commitment to my company, to my people who work for me; there are over a hundred people that I'm answerable to.\n\n\"I'm not going to sit in the courts because of ridiculous, completely bigoted individuals who have no education, no intelligence, who go into some kind of rapture for publicity.\"\n\nAccording to Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), a 155-year-old colonial-era law, a same-sex relationship is an \"unnatural offence\". Last February, the Supreme Court agreed to revisit a previous judgement that upheld the law.\n\nIn deeply conservative India, homosexuality is a taboo and many people still regard same-sex relationships as illegitimate.\n\nHowever that has not mitigated the outpouring of anger against Johar.\n\nOne of his strongest critics is Apurva Asrani, a script writer and editor of Aligarh, a gay rights Bollywood film based on true incidents.\n\nAsrani went on social media to criticise Johar's autobiography and his resistance to coming out, saying that he was \"appalled\". He called Johar's extract on his sexuality a \"regressive and a cowardly statement\".\n\nJohar's book also details his lonely childhood. He talks about growing up with weight issues in a plush neighbourhood in Mumbai among children of the film industry as his father was a producer.\n\nThe memoir talks about Johar's friendship with Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan\n\nThe book also talks about Johar's well known friendship with Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan and his spats with Bollywood's leading ladies.\n\nJohar's films have been set in locations in America or Britain dealing with the romantic issues of the rich and the beautiful.\n\nHis films have been criticised for stereotyping women as in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and for peddling fluff.\n\nThey have often poked fun of gay characters and have used innuendos and jokes while referencing gays in his films.\n\nHis production house may have backed many meaningful films that have spoken about gay issues with sensitivity, but his own storytelling in his movies and memoir is wanting, say critics.\n\nIn addition to his films, Johar also hosts a hugely popular television chat show filled with Bollywood's beautiful people discussing their crushes, courting controversies, fuelling gossip and adult jokes.\n\nIn the show, Johar also allows gay jokes, uses self-mocking throwaway lines about his sexuality and uses innuendo which has irked critics for trivialising his sexuality.\n\nBut he also has his supporters. \"His book is remarkably candid and courageous. He has shared his vulnerabilities and fears,\" writer and publisher Shobhaa De said of Johar.\n\nJohar, one of the cleverest and most influential Bollywood directors, isn't giving the pleasure of saying what everyone knows, gay rights notwithstanding.",

            "description": "A social media post written by a former NHS director of mental health about her own depression has gone viral",
            "section": "BBC Trending",
            "content": "\"Perhaps not the most flattering photo of me, but I'm sharing this awful picture and my story to help increase understanding of the impact of mental illness and to celebrate my recovery.\"\n\n\"As I have worked in mental health services for 29 years, one would think I would be immune to mental illness.\"\n\nIn a LinkedIn post that has been shared more than 5,000 times, Mandy Stevens shared a photo of herself, red-eyed with matted hair, in the midst of a depressive episode that resulted in her being hospitalised. She wrote the post on the day she was discharged from a 12 week stay on the inpatient ward at the City and Hackney Centre for Mental Health in London.\n\nOne thing that struck many people who read Stevens' post on the online professional network was her unique vantage point - she has been both an employee and patient of the UK's National Health Service mental health programme.\n\nStevens began her career in the NHS as a mental health nurse. After 15 years she became a hospital manager, and then a director.\n\nAlthough she has suffered episodes of \"mild to moderate\" depression, she managed it through counselling and very few of her family and friends knew about it.\n\n\"There is a huge amount of stigma around mental illness,\" Stevens told BBC Trending, \"and for the past 29 years I have worked in Mental Health Services and seen the negative effect this stigma has on people who use our services. From personal embarrassment, family embarrassment, not accepting diagnoses or treatment, not wanting to attend mental health community services in case they are recognised. There is also stigma amongst family, friends and colleagues, including whispered rumours and avoidance.\"\n\nThen in November, things changed, and her depression became serious enough to warrant hospitalisation.\n\n\"When I was very, very depressed, anxious and suicidal I was so ill I was almost monosyllabic, I could hardy walk properly, I couldn't shower or dress properly. Eating and all the things that we take for granted were a huge struggle. I spent most of every day in bed, crying and wanting to be dead. I was absolutely terrible. So frightening and awful.\"\n\n\"The absolutely wonderful nurses on Gardner ward at City & Hackney Centre for Mental Health were amazing,\" Stevens says.\n\n\"They would come and see me very regularly throughout the day, spend time with me, encourage and support me, listen to me crying and talking and throwing up a huge amount of emotion. The staff nurses and the healthcare assistants were wonderful, accessible and compassionate 24/7. I am so proud of my profession.\"\n\nWhilst in hospital and after she was over the worst Stevens says she felt a bit like an \"undercover cop\" as she observed how the ward was run.\n\n\"Without exception the staff treated all of the patients with dignity and respect.\"\n\nWhen asked what she thinks of the state of the NHS right now, Stevens says, \"Very difficult for me to answer this question now\u2026 I can only talk about my particular experience as a patient in an 'Outstanding Trust' - which has been a great experience.\"\n\n\"I am, of course, aware that not everyone is as lucky as me to receive this type of care. Unfortunately, mental health services are always seen as the 'Cinderella services' with lower levels of funding and cuts.\"\n\nAnalysis by the King's Fund think tank says 40% of the 58 mental health trusts in the UK saw budgets cut in 2015-16. It found six of them had seen budgets cut three years in a row. An NHS spokeswoman told the BBC that mental health services were \"wider\" than trusts, and care was funded in other ways.\n\nSteven adds that help is there.\n\n\"There is a huge range of accessible services across the country. Your GP is usually the best place to start as they can signpost you to local services and, if necessary, they can refer you to formal mental health services, but there are also a wide variety of other services around run by volunteers,\" she says.\n\n\"My first message is to reach out to people. Speak to your close family and friends about your mental health, and start opening conversations about it. Don't say 'I'm okay' when you're not okay\"\n\nNext story: Trolls try to trigger seizures - is it assault?\n\nCan sending a flashing animated picture constitute a physical assault against someone with epilepsy?
