            "content": "Theresa May's Brexit plan \"could see the UK quit the EU single market\", according to many of Sunday's front pages.\n\n\"May's big gamble on a clean Brexit,\" is the main headline in the Sunday Telegraph, which reports the content of the prime minister's much-anticipated speech this week is being \"closely guarded\" by Number 10.\n\nBut citing \"numerous government sources\", the paper says the prime minister is expected to indicate she is prepared to take Britain out of the single market and the customs union.\n\n\"She's gone for the full works,\" a source tells the Sunday Telegraph. \"People will know that when she said 'Brexit means Brexit', she really meant it.\"\n\nThe Sunday Times believes Mrs May will try to reassure voters who backed the Remain side, by suggesting that she could strike a transitional deal on Brexit, avoiding \"a cliff-edge\" for British business.\n\nThe Sunday People highlights what it says will be an appeal to everyone to unite behind Mrs May's vision for leaving the EU.\n\n\"The victors in the EU referendum have a responsibility to act magnanimously,\" the paper quotes pre-released extracts from the speech as saying. \"The losers have a responsibility to respect the result.\"\n\nThe NHS winter crisis features in some of Sunday's newspapers\n\nThe winter crisis in the NHS receives further coverage with the Observer reporting that \"a large number of hospitals across the UK\" have been cancelling some cancer operations since the start of this year.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday leads with the results of a Survation poll, which found that more than three-quarters of 12,000 people surveyed believed money from the foreign aid budget should be diverted to the NHS.\n\nThe Sunday Times leads with a suggestion that Donald Trump is planning to hold a summit with Vladimir Putin, within weeks of becoming US President.\n\nIt says he hopes to emulate Ronald Reagan's Cold-War deal-making with Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nOn its front page, the Observer carries a claim by the former Foreign Office minister, Chris Bryant, who says he's \"certain\" Russia is targeting senior British politicians, to try to find out potentially compromising details about their private lives.\n\nOn the letters page of the Sunday Telegraph, 50 Conservative MPs urge the government to bring in tougher strike laws. They want walkouts on \"critical public infrastructure\", such as train and bus services, to be banned unless a judge decides the action is proportionate.\n\nThe Sun on Sunday reports that the rail company Southern is preparing to recruit 200 part-time drivers to keep trains running during strikes.\n\nFirst it was \"trousergate\", in which Theresa May's \"high-end\" wardrobe choices caused a storm, now she is to grace the pages of the world's most influential fashion bible. This is according to the Mail on Sunday, which reveals that the prime minister has posed for the renowned photographer, Annie Leibovitz, in a fashion shoot for American Vogue.\n\nThe Sun on Sunday says the aim is to make the Theresa May appear \"more personable\" to British voters.\n\nBut the Mail on Sunday takes a different view and says it is part of a Downing Street strategy to cosy up to the new administration in the White House, after being \"wrong-footed\" by the presidential election result.\n\n\"Theresa knows she needs to raise her profile in the US,\" a source tells the paper. \"The Vogue shoot will form a central part of Operation Trump.\"",

            "section": "Asia",
            "content": "Three gold medals, two world records and one Lego figurine under her belt. But what's next for Singapore Paralympian Yip Pin Xiu? The BBC's Heather Chen profiles the young athlete, as part of a series on the Asian women likely to make the news in 2017.\n\nSwimmer Joseph Schooling may have delivered Singapore its first-ever Olympic gold medal but Yip Pin Xiu remains the country's most decorated athlete. With her 2016 and 2008 wins in Rio and Beijing, Yip now has more gold medals to her name than any other Singaporean Olympian or Paralympian.\n\nBut setting her sights on too much and not having enough time is often a problem for the busy 24-year-old, who's just returned from Europe, where she spent Christmas with her boyfriend and family.\n\nSchool has started and Yip is back home. The swimmer is currently studying for her degree in political science at the Singapore Management University, which recently set up a sports scholarship in her name.\n\nIt's evident that Yip's heart is still in the pool. She says she is \"in a hurry\" to graduate so she can resume full-time training and even though she is training up to five times a week, Yip wants to dedicate more hours to it.\n\n\"Training isn't as intensive for me now as it normally is in the lead-up to major games,\" she said.\n\nBut balancing commitments is no easy feat, let alone for a three-time Paralympic champion.\n\n\"Juggling school and training takes up a lot of my time. And the only travelling I'll be doing for the rest of the year will be for competitions, not holidays,\" she says.\n\nBut it's not impossible for her. \"Since young, I've learnt to manage my time. It's difficult but I can do it.\"\n\nThe youngest of three children, Yip was born with muscular dystrophy, a genetic disorder that slowly breaks down the muscles.\n\nWhen she turned 11, she lost her ability to walk and had to rely on a wheelchair. By age 12, she ventured into the world of competitive swimming.\n\nYip also suffers from a nerve condition that affects her eyesight. But she remains infectiously optimistic about her life.\n\n\"Things are so good and I'm really happy,\" she said with a smile.\n\nOn that, she recalled her biggest highlight of 2016: winning at the Rio Paralympics.\n\n\"My teammates and I were overwhelmed. The recognition we received was a lot higher compared to what we ever had,\" she said.\n\n\"I will always remember how good it felt to return home to Singapore, to see all the support for Paralympians.\"\n\nYip is known in the sporting world for her signature back stroke swim\n\nRio may have been just the beginning for Yip Pin Xiu but there is still more to come. All eyes will be on her during her next major swim at the ASEAN Para Games scheduled to take place in September.\n\n\"My biggest competitor is myself and I want to be even better than that,\" Yip said.\n\nShe is also gearing for Tokyo 2020, which she says will be \"a very exciting and vibrant event\".\n\nBut does she have her sights set on a fourth gold? She had this to say:\n\n\"Committing myself to the next Paralympics can be scary and after three medals, I don't know what else could be better.\n\nBut there's a high possibility that I will go on for more years of training and competition. If I see a potential, I'll keep going.\"\n\n'Paralympians need the same kind of support like any other athlete'\n\nWith those milestones some time away, can Yip count on the celebratory spirit and support of 2016?\n\n\"I wouldn't say that support for Paralympic athletes is dying down. Attention has diminished but that's only natural,\" she enthused.\n\n\"A lot of people still step forward to lend their support and offer their help and assistance.\"\n\nYip and her fellow Paralympian Theresa Goh were immortalised as Lego figurines\n\nYip has found tremendous support in her fellow Paralympian Theresa Goh, who herself has racked up world records and medals.\n\nBeyond the headlines, both girls enjoy an endearing friendship often documented on their social media accounts. In 2016, toy maker Lego cemented the duo's star status with their very own figurines.\n\n\"We know we have a bond and we don't have to verbally remind each other of our support,\" she said.\n\n\"I can tell Theresa anything. It's nice having someone to talk to, who wouldn't judge you for anything and just listen.\"\n\nOver the years, Yip has made various contributions to public debate in Singapore about the treatment and recognition of its disabled athletes.\n\n\"I want the world to know that being a disabled athlete is not that different from being an able-bodied one,\" she said.\n\n\"We put in the same number of hours and we need support like any other athlete. I would like people to look beyond the disability and see the individual instead.\"\n\nShe regularly takes time out from her busy schedule to lend her support to events that raise awareness of disabled sport.\n\n\"I want our community to go beyond their limits and not believe the negativity.\"\n\nAnd water presents her with more challenges she wants to conquer in the coming year. Could scuba diving be on the cards for the world champion?\n\nWill Singapore's champion swimmer soon take up a new water sport?\n\n\"I love swimming but strangely, I've never dived before. Diving is interesting and I wouldn't mind learning as I love nature and being in the water so it would be quite an experience.\"\n\nBut she has some concerns because in the water, Yip does not have the ability to kick her legs and so channels her strength into her arms.\n\n\"Divers propel themselves in the water using flippers so I don't know how I'd do it,\" she admitted.\n\n\"There are special programmes in Singapore that offer disabled people a chance to dive so I know it isn't impossible, I just need to find the time.\"\n\nThe coming year could see her shattering even more barriers.",

            "description": "How would you feel if the person sitting next to you on the bus was watching porn - and what would you do about it?",
            "section": "Magazine",
            "content": "It's no secret that lots of people watch pornography on the internet. It's usually something done behind closed doors - but how would you feel about someone watching porn in public? The BBC's Siobhann Tighe describes a troubling experience on a London bus.\n\nIt had been a long day at work. I got on the bus at 7.30 in the evening and it was cold and drizzly. All the passengers were wrapped up in thick coats, hoods and hats.\n\nInside, the bus was softly lit and I was expecting to zone out on my way back home: just let the day go and switch off.\n\nI sat on the lower deck beside a complete stranger and didn't give it a second thought. I was just relieved to get a seat. As we meandered through the London traffic, my gaze was drawn to my neighbour's phone. I wasn't being nosy but in the dim light of the bus, the brightness of his mobile caught my attention even though he was slanting it slightly away from me.\n\nAlthough I didn't mean to or want to, I found myself looking over towards his mobile a few times and then it suddenly occurred to me what was going on. The man beside me was watching porn.\n\nOnce I realised, although I genuinely didn't mean to, my eyes kept on being pulled back to it. I couldn't quite believe it. First he was watching animated porn, with the two naked characters in lurid colours repeating their movements over and over again. Then he started watching a film, which seemed to begin in a petrol station with a large woman in a low-cut yellow top and blonde hair peering into the driver's window.\n\nI didn't hear any sound, apart from a brief few seconds when my fellow passenger pulled the headphone jack out of his mobile, and then reinserted it.\n\nThe man didn't seem to notice my glances towards his phone, maybe because his hood was hampering his peripheral vision. He seemed oblivious to me and others around him, who admittedly wouldn't have been able to see what I saw.\n\nWe eventually arrived at his bus stop and because he had the window seat and I had the aisle, he made a motion that he needed to get out, and he muttered a \"thank you\" as he squeezed past me. I watched him get off and walk down the street.\n\nI felt uncomfortable and annoyed, but I didn't do anything about it. I didn't say anything to him and neither did he pick up on any of my glances or quizzical looks. His eyes didn't meet mine so I couldn't even communicate my feelings non-verbally and it didn't occur to me to tell the driver. Even if I wanted to, it would have been difficult to get to the front of the bus because it was packed.\n\nBut when I got off, questions flooded into my mind about what I had just experienced. What if a child saw that? Are there any laws about looking at porn in public spaces? If there are laws, how easy are they to enforce? Why did this passenger feel public transport was an appropriate place to watch porn, and should I be worried from a safety point of view?\n\nAs a journalist, I also looked at it from his point of view, even though he made me feel uncomfortable. I asked myself: is he within his rights to look at porn on his private device wherever he is? Do civil liberties in our society grant him that freedom?\n\nBut in my heart, I was offended.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. From disgust to it's ok, Woman's Hour took to the streets to find out what you think of it.\n\nWhen I mentioned it to friends, everyone seemed to have a story of their own, or an opinion.\n\n\"It happened to me when I was with my son having a coffee at a Swiss airport,\" one said. \"Two Italian guys were sitting next to me. I said something because I felt safe and I sensed there'd be support if an argument ensued.\" It worked, and they politely switched the laptop off.\n\nIt certainly got everyone talking, but like me, no-one was sure where the law stood.\n\nAccording to Prof Clare McGlynn from Durham University who specialises in the law around porn, there's little to stop someone viewing pornographic material in public - on public transport, in a library, in a park or a cafe, for example.\n\n\"It's like reading a book,\" she says. \"They are viewing lawful material which is freely available, and restricting people's access to it presents other challenges.\"\n\nIn Prof McGlynn's view, the law would only prevent it if the porn viewer is harassing someone or causing a disturbance.\n\nSo, what do you do? Prof McGlynn describes it as a dilemma.\n\n\"It's like someone shouting at you, calling to you to 'Cheer up, love!'\" says Prof McGlynn. \"Do you confront it, or do you put your head down and walk along?\"\n\nBut when I contacted Transport for London, they appeared to take the case very seriously.\n\n\"If someone has made you feel uncomfortable, for example by viewing pornographic material, please tell the police or a member of our staff,\" I was told.\n\nA member of staff said passengers should report incidents like to this to the bus driver, who would tell the control centre, and the information would then be passed to the police for them to investigate.\n\nIn Prof McGlynn's view, there is not much the police could do. On the other hand, James Turner QC contacted the BBC to say that there is a law - the Indecent Displays (Control) Act - which might form the basis for a prosecution.\n\nFive years ago, in the US, the executive director of a group called Morality in the Media had an experience similar to mine on an aeroplane. As a result, the group - now called the National Center On Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE) - campaigned to get the major US airlines to stop passengers watching porn.\n\n\"All of them except for one agreed to improve their policies to prohibit passengers from viewing this material during flights and agreed to better train their flight attendants on what to do,\" Haley Halverson of NCOSE told me.\n\nBuses don't have flight attendants, though. Nor do trains. And even if police wanted to investigate incidents of porn-watching on public transport, passengers can get off whenever they like.\n\nHow would officers catch them and question them then?\n\nSiobhann Tighe and Prof Clare McGlynn spoke to Jenni Murray on Woman's Hour, on BBC Radio 4.

            "description": "Russia denies collecting scandalous material on the US president-elect - but what is 'kompromat'?",
            "section": "Europe",
            "content": "Mr Trump scorned as \"fake news\" claims that Russia holds compromising material about his private life\n\nEvery Russian knows what \"kompromat\" means. Now, thanks to a graphic section of the unverified intelligence dossier on Donald Trump, the rest of the world does, too.\n\nSince the allegations were made public, the US president-elect has denied claims that he cavorted in Russia with prostitutes - and Russian officials have denied claims that they filmed it.\n\nThis week, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin told me that \"the Kremlin does not collect kompromat\".\n\nBut someone in Russia clearly does. And the sensational results periodically surface, either via the compliant state media or via the internet.\n\nLast spring was a case in point.\n\nA state-controlled TV channel, NTV, ran footage of former Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov in bed with his personal assistant, Natalia Pelevina. Not only was the material cringe-worthily intimate, it also revealed the couple bad-mouthing other members of Russia's notoriously divided opposition.\n\nThe tape helped divide them even further.\n\n\"It was shot inside a private apartment by the [Russian security service] FSB, there is no doubt about it,\" Ms Pelevina told the BBC, referring to what happened as an \"obvious smear campaign\".\n\nGrainy video footage showed Mr Kasyanov with his personal assistant in a bedroom\n\nThere is no evidence that America's president-elect was ever caught in a similar way. But Ms Pelevina argues that her own experience suggests that such an idea is not implausible.\n\n\"I would not rule out that the Russian FSB has something against Donald Trump. Because they collect those materials not just against enemies; they collect against so-called friends. Just in case it will come in handy one day,\" she said.\n\nSome argue that the FSB had no reason to ensnare Mr Trump before his presidential ambitions were public.\n\n\"What would have been the point?\" Frederick Forsyth, a spy author who worked for MI6 for 20 years, asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday.\n\n\"I don't think there's any indication that the man who was host of the game show Apprentice and builder of hotels was ever going to be anything important in the political world,\" he said.\n\nBut a former Russian intelligence agent dismissed that logic.\n\n\"Donald Trump was never just anyone. He was always a well-known businessman, not just a tourist,\" the former operative, who asked not to be named, pointed out.\n\n\"You call it 'kompromat', but it's just information. Everyone does it. You British gathered it on [Mikhail] Gorbachev, we gathered it on [Margaret] Thatcher. So theoretically, yes, it's possible,\" he said.\n\nIf Russian agents did gather such information, he said, then it would be no surprise that it got out.\n\n\"You can't be surprised by anything anymore, after Edward Snowden and after Wikileaks,\" the ex-agent said.\n\nThat is one reason why many Russians are unfazed by the allegations. Another is that they have seen it all before.\n\nThe most notorious victim of kompromat was Yury Skuratov. The then-prosecutor general was investigating claims of corruption in the Kremlin in the late 1990s when Russian TV aired a video entitled Three in a Bed.\n\nThe grainy footage, which ended his career, showed a man resembling Mr Skuratov in bed with two women. The tape's authenticity was confirmed publicly by none other than Mr Putin, then head of the FSB.\n\nProsecutor General Skuratov was sacked in 2000 after a video appeared to show him with prostitutes\n\nThen there was Mumu. In 2010, the part-time model befriended opposition activists and journalists and lured them back to her flat. Their sexual activities and drug-taking were all captured on hidden cameras. The films were then posted on the internet.\n\nAnd the technique has been turned on foreign targets, too.\n\nThe British deputy consul-general in Yekaterinburg was forced to step down in 2009 after footage allegedly showing his own sexual encounter with two prostitutes was made public.\n\nThe UK Foreign Office declined to comment at the time, only stating that it expected \"high levels of personal and professional integrity\" from its staff.\n\nThe list goes on and the FSB is always cited as the prime suspect.\n\nThe big difference with the claims of kompromat against Mr Trump is, of course, that his alleged video tape has not been made public.",

            "content": "Theresa May's plan to make GPs in England open their surgeries seven days a week features on several of Saturday's front pages.\n\nThe Daily Mail says the \"personal intervention\" by the prime minister comes as \"thousands\" of surgeries close early on weekday afternoons, \"while others take a three-hour lunch break\".\n\nAccording to the Daily Telegraph, access to a major package of government funding will be \"contingent\" on GPs being able to demonstrate they are offering appointments when patients want them.\n\nThe Times warns that many GPs \"are likely to be incensed\" by the plan, after years of claiming there are too few of them to cope with an ageing population.\n\nThe Conservative chair of the Commons Health Select Committee has said the Tories \"risk losing the trust of voters\" on the NHS in an interview with the newspaper.\n\nDr Sarah Wollaston, who was a GP before entering parliament, says the system is \"underfunded\", and warns that \"relentless\" pressures on staff are contributing to what she describes as a \"human crisis\".\n\nShe denies that GPs are lazy, claiming she has never encountered one who plays golf during the day, and instead argues that the key to dealing with problems in the NHS is to increase funding for social care.\n\nThe Guardian reports that Michel Barnier is \"backing away from his hardline approach\" to Brexit\n\nThe lead story in the Guardian details how the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said he wants a \"special\" relationship with the City of London to continue to give EU countries easy access to the financial centre after Britain leaves.\n\nThe paper says it has seen unpublished minutes that hint at \"unease\" about the costs of Brexit on the rest of the EU, and give the \"first signs\" that Mr Barnier is \"backing away from his hardline approach\".\n\nThe European Commission has insisted the minutes \"do not correctly reflect\" what was said, but a source has described them to the Guardian as \"more or less accurate\".\n\nTristram Hunt's decision to quit as the Labour MP for Stoke Central is widely seen as bad news for Jeremy Corbyn in Saturday's newspapers.\n\nThe Daily Express claims Labour will need a \"miracle\" to retain the seat in a by-election.\n\nFor the Times, the resignation underlines Labour's \"poor leadership and dearth of talent\", while the Sun believes life is \"too short\" to spend a decade in \"impotent opposition\".\n\nOnly the Daily Mail is critical of Mr Hunt, arguing that his new job as director of the Victoria and Albert Museum means he joins \"multitudes of like-thinking left-wing luvvies\" running \"almost every public body in the country\".\n\nLord Snowdon features on several front pages following his death aged 86\n\nPhotographs of Lord Snowdon are printed on several front pages, including the Daily Express which claims the Queen has been \"left saddened\" by the death of her former brother-in-law at the age of 86.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph notes that he was seen as \"one of the country's foremost photographers, but became known for his many affairs\", a fact which prompts The Sun to describe him as \"the romping rock'n'roll royal rebel\".\n\nThe Daily Mirror highlights some of his \"iconic\" images, including photographs of David Bowie and Sir Richard Branson, and praises his portraits of the royal family for capturing \"a more human side\".",
