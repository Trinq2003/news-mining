            "description": "Should scientists be allowed to experiment on embryos beyond 14 days of development?",
            "section": "Health",
            "content": "Experts are renewing calls to allow experiments on embryos beyond 14 days of development, saying it would drive medical breakthroughs.\n\nResearch on human embryos can only happen under a licence in the UK and it is currently illegal to keep them alive in laboratories for more than two weeks after fertilisation.\n\nUntil recently, this cut-off was almost irrelevant in terms of viability since science had not found a way to physically support life in the lab beyond about a week.\n\nBut researchers have found a way to chemically mimic the womb which would allow an early stage embryo to continue to develop for longer - at least 13 days after fertilisation, but potentially much more.\n\nOne of the pioneers of IVF is calling for a government inquiry.\n\nProf Simon Fishel was on the team involved with the birth of the world's first IVF baby. He believes that moving the limit to 28 days would be good for furthering scientific understanding.\n\nProf Fishel, who founded the CARE Fertility Group, said: \"I believe the benefits we will gain by eventually moving forwards when the case is proven will be of enormous importance to human health.\"\n\nObserving how the embryo changes over weeks could shed light on why some early miscarriages occur, he says.\n\nEmbryos normally implant in the wall of the uterus at around day seven and still resemble a ball of cells at that stage.\n\nIt takes weeks of rapid cell division and growth before it begins to resemble something more baby-like, with a beating heart, developing eyes and budding limbs.\n\nMagdalena Zernicka-Goetz has developed a technique that could, theoretically, allow embryos to survive for longer in the lab than the current legal limit of 14 days.\n\nThe Cambridge University professor says: \"We know that a lot of pregnancies fail on the time of implantation which is day seven. So now we can identify events which are not happening correctly and how in future we can help them occur normally.\"\n\nBut there are many who are concerned about extending the legal limit.\n\nProf Fishel said: \"There are some religious groups that will be fundamentally against IVF, let alone IVF research in any circumstances, and we have to respect their views.\"\n\nThe 14-day rule was first suggested in the UK in 1984. With the advent of IVF, a committee, chaired by Mary Warnock, was set up to look at the ethics and regulation of this new technology.\n\nIt concluded that the human embryo should be protected, but that research on embryos and IVF would be permissible, given appropriate safeguards.\n\nSetting a cut-off was tricky. For example, should it be based on when an embryo develops a nervous system that might begin to detect pain? At the time, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists suggested 17 days as a limit - the point at which early neural development begins.\n\nThe Warnock report settled on 14 days - when the embryo is a distinct individual and can no longer form a twin.\n\nThat recommendation is now decades old. Some say it should be reviewed.\n\nDavid Jones, founder of the Centre of Bioethics and Emerging Technologies, is against changing the limit.\n\n\"It would be a stepping stone to the culturing of embryos and even foetuses outside the womb. You are really beyond the stage when the embryo would otherwise implant and that is a step towards to creating womb like environment outside. People will then ask why can't we shift it beyond 28 days?\"\n\nA recent YouGov poll of 1,740, commissioned by the BBC, found that 48% of the UK general public supported increasing the limit up to 28 days, 19% wanted to keep the present limit of 14 days and 10% wanted a total ban.\n\nBut one in four of those questioned said they did not know, suggesting some may need more information to reach an informed opinion.\n\nBBC Radio 4's two-part documentary 'Revisiting the 14 day rule' starts on Tuesday 17 January at 11:00 GMT.",

            "section": "Asia",
            "content": "An Afghan woman made famous by a 1985 National Geographic cover has spoken exclusively to the BBC of her hope for a new beginning, after being deported from Pakistan.\n\nSharbat Gula now lives with her five-year-old son and three daughters in Kabul, where she says she wants to live a normal life after years of tragedy and hardship.\n\nHer portrait as a 10-year-old became an iconic image of Afghan refugees fleeing war.\n\nThe only time she has spoken to the media before now, her family says, was for a 2002 documentary after Steve McCurry, who took her original photo, tracked her down in Pakistan and found out who she was.\n\nSharbat Gula had no idea that her face had been famous around the world for almost 17 years.\n\nLike many Afghans, she sought refuge in Pakistan and lived there for 35 years - but she was imprisoned and deported last autumn for obtaining Pakistani identity papers \"illegally\".\n\n\"We had a good time there, had good neighbours, lived among our own Pashtun brothers. But I didn't expect that the Pakistani government would treat me like this at the end,\" Sharbat Gula told me at her temporary residence in Kabul.\n\nHer case highlighted the arbitrary arrest and forced deportation of Afghan refugees in the current spat between the two countries.\n\nIt has been illegal for non-Pakistanis to have IDs since they were first issued in the 1970s, but the law was often not enforced.\n\nNow sick and frail in her mid-40s, Sharbat Gula's haunting eyes are still piercing, full of both fear and hope.\n\nShe says she had already sold her house in Pakistan because she feared arrest there for \"not having proper documents to stay\".\n\nTwo days before a planned move back to Afghanistan, her house was raided late in the evening and she was taken to prison.\n\nSharbat Gula was sentenced to 15 days in prison\n\nPakistan's government has ordered all two million Afghan refugees on its soil to leave.\n\nSharbat Gula believes the Pakistani authorities wanted to arrest her before she left.\n\n\"I told the police that I have made this ID card for only two things - to educate my children and sell my house - which were not possible to do without the ID card.\"\n\nShe served a 15-day prison sentence, the first week in prison and the second in hospital where she was treated for hepatitis C.\n\n\"This was the hardest and worst incident in my life.\"\n\nRealising the reputational damage, Pakistan later offered to let her stay - but she refused.\n\n\"I told them that I am going to my country. I said: 'You allowed me here for 35 years, but at the end treated me like this.' It is enough.\"\n\nHer husband and eldest daughter died in Peshawar and are buried there.\n\n\"If I wanted to go back, it will be just to offer prayer at the graves of my husband and daughter who are buried in front of the house we lived in.\"\n\nThe \"Afghan Girl\" picture was taken by Steve McCurry in 1984 in a refugee camp near Peshawar, when Sharbat Gula was studying in a tent school. Published in 1985, it became one of the most recognisable magazine covers ever printed.\n\nFor years she was unaware of her celebrity.\n\n\"When my brother showed me the picture, I recognised myself and told him that yes, this is my photo.\"\n\n\"I became very surprised [because] I didn't like media and taking photos from childhood. At first, I was concerned about the publicity of my photo but when I found out that I have been the cause of support/help for many people/refugees, then I became happy.\"\n\nSharbat Gula has now returned to Afghanistan, where the government promised her a house in Kabul\n\nNone of Sharbat Gula's six children - another daughter died too at an early age and is buried in Peshawar - share the colour of her eyes.\n\nBut her brother, Kashar Khan, does, and the eyes of one of her three sisters were also green.\n\nShe says her maternal grandmother had eyes of a similar colour.\n\nSharbat Gula was a child living with her family in Kot district of eastern Nangarhar province when Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan in 1979.\n\n\"There was war between Russians and Afghanistan - that is why we left. A lot of damage/destruction was done.\"\n\nHer mother died of appendicitis in the village when she was eight. Like hundreds of thousands of other Afghans, her family (her father, four sisters and one brother) migrated to Pakistan and started living in a tent in a refugee camp called Kacha Garahi, on the outskirts of Peshawar.\n\nShe was married at 13. But her husband, Rahmat Gul, was later diagnosed with hepatitis C and died about five years ago. Her eldest daughter also died of hepatitis three years ago, aged 22, leaving a two-month-old daughter.\n\nSharbat Gula met President Ashraf Ghani in the presidential palace on her return, and later former President Hamid Karzai.\n\n\"They gave me respect, warmly welcomed me. I thank them. May God treat them well.\"\n\nAfghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani received her at the presidential palace\n\nThe government has promised to support her financially and buy her a house in Kabul.\n\n\"I hope the government will fulfil all its promises,\" she told me.\n\nKot district is a stronghold of militants linked to the so-called Islamic State group, so she can't go home to her village. Her green-eyed brother and hundreds of others have fled the area, fearing IS brutality.\n\n\"We cannot even visit our village now because of insecurity and don't have a shelter in Jalalabad. Our life is a struggle from one hardship to another,\" he says.\n\nBut Sharbat Gula's priority is to stay in her country, get better and see her children be educated and live happy lives.\n\n\"I want to establish a charity or a hospital to treat all poor, orphans and widows,\" she says.\n\n\"I would like peace to come to this country, so that people don't become homeless. May God fix this country.\"",

            "section": null,
            "content": "Valtteri Bottas faces the opportunity and challenge of his life following his switch to Mercedes for 2017.\n\nAfter four seasons of solid performances with Williams, the 27-year-old Finn has been rewarded with every driver's dream - a seat with the best team in Formula 1.\n\nBarring a remarkable slip in form for Mercedes, Bottas will morph from being an occasional podium visitor to a race-winner and possibly title contender this year.\n\nBut in new team-mate Lewis Hamilton, Bottas faces an adversary far beyond anything he has experienced so far. How he measures up will likely define the rest of his career.\n\nBottas might not be the most exciting of choices for Mercedes. Fans around the world would have loved to see Hamilton battle McLaren's Fernando Alonso again, or take on Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo or Max Verstappen, or Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. But his appeal to Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff is obvious.\n\nBottas is Wolff's attempt to find a like-for-like replacement for German Nico Rosberg, who dropped Mercedes in the mire by announcing his retirement last year, five days after clinching his first world title. And it's not just about their blond hair or Finnish ancestry.\n\nBottas shares many of Rosberg's characteristics. Both are calm, unobtrusive characters, who are generally pliable and understanding in terms of working with the team and lack the demanding nature of a Hamilton or Alonso.\n\nOn the track they are consistent, largely error-free performers. And Bottas has proved himself a resilient and hard racer.\n\nWolff should - he hopes - be able to plug Bottas in and carry on pretty much where Mercedes left off in the past few years.\n\nWolff rates Bottas extremely highly. But now he has joined Mercedes, the big question is: how good is he?\n\nThere have been flashes of brilliance - such as qualifying third in the wet in an uncompetitive Williams in Canada in 2013 - that suggest a real talent.\n\nAnd overall, the general perception is Bottas' record against Felipe Massa at Williams over the past three years is similar to Alonso's against the Brazilian at Ferrari before that.\n\nBut the facts do not bear that out. While Bottas and Alonso beat Massa in both qualifying and races, the Spaniard's advantage over the Brazilian was significantly bigger.\n\nDirectly comparing the data suggests Bottas is as much as 0.2-0.3 seconds per lap slower than Alonso and considerably less effective in races.\n\nNeither Massa nor Bottas have been team-mates to Hamilton. But Alonso has - at McLaren in 2007. They finished tied on points, with four wins each, and Hamilton edged qualifying by the tiniest of margins. By any measure, it was - and is - very difficult to separate Hamilton and Alonso.\n\nIf 2017 follows the trend of those results, Hamilton can be expected to be comfortably quicker than Bottas.\n\nPerhaps more surprising is that those comparisons suggest that not only is Bottas not a match for Alonso and Hamilton, but he might not equal Rosberg either.\n\nHowever, drivers' form does not always directly translate across teams and rivals in as linear a fashion as might be expected.\n\nIt is up to Bottas to prove the comparisons wrong and grab the opportunity with both hands.\n\nBottas was always the only realistic option once Wolff decided against Mercedes junior Pascal Wehrlein. Bottas is quick, dependable, has had a management relationship with Wolff, and raced for a team that had Mercedes engines, and with which a deal therefore might more easily be done.\n\nAll the A-list drivers - Alonso, Ricciardo, Verstappen and Vettel - were not available. They are under contract to leading teams that would have been left in a similar position to Mercedes had they allowed them to leave.\n\nBut if they had been available, Wolff may not have wanted most of them anyway.\n\nPart of the decision to sign the same type of driver as Rosberg was a desire to retain the team dynamic.\n\nRosberg and Hamilton worked for Mercedes because only one of them saw it as a right and expectation to be in front. Spoken or not, there was a natural order. They were, as one senior Mercedes insider once put it, \"a great driver and a very good one\".\n\nThis is a way of keeping the rivalry manageable and under control without the need for too much team interference.\n\nThe faster driver - Hamilton - knows he will win most of the time as long as he performs at his best. And the other one - a different personality - is able to keep defeat in perspective more easily when it happens.\n\nAs Wolff put it on Monday: \"Valtteri shares our values and passion, and he's modest, humble and hard-working.\"\n\nBut there is a possibility the team dynamic will change anyway.\n\nHow might it affect Hamilton?\n\nDaimler chairman Dieter Zetsche recently provided an amusing insight into Mercedes' relationship with Hamilton.\n\nTalking to Autocar magazine about how he heard the news of Rosberg's retirement, Zetsche said: \"I was stepping out of the shower lacking any clothes and my phone was ringing. And I saw it was Toto and I thought: 'Oh, again something with Lewis!'\"\n\nHis remarks confirm the open secret that Hamilton is not an easy driver to manage.\n\nLike all drivers of his stature, Hamilton can be awkward over PR appearances and other such matters that are expected of drivers but they find tiresome. And he has repeatedly bucked against the authority of the team.\n\nIn ignoring orders to speed up while 'backing' Rosberg into rivals in the title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi, Hamilton was metaphorically sticking two fingers up to team management.\n\nWolff initially said he would consider what actions to take. Then, Hamilton spoke of feeling \"disrespected\" by that call. Following Rosberg's retirement, Wolff and soon-to-leave technical boss Paddy Lowe said the orders should not have been issued.\n\nThroughout last season, Hamilton repeatedly brought up the reliability disparity that was giving Rosberg an advantage in their title battle.\n\nIn Malaysia - after his engine failed while he was leading, costing him the championship lead and, as it turned out, the title - he went as far as saying \"something or someone doesn't want me to win this year\".\n\nMany interpreted that wrongly as a suggestion there was a conspiracy in the team. But even as a reference to bad luck or divine intervention, it is a statement that causes Mercedes problems.\n\nAfter Hamilton refused to take questions in a news conference at the Japanese Grand Prix last year, Wolff called such incidents \"collateral damage\", and insisted \"his performances in the car justify\" it.\n\nBut sometimes - if very rarely - Hamilton is not phenomenal in the car. And some in F1 question his 'off' weekends and occasional problematic behaviour as directly linked to his decision to pursue a Hollywood lifestyle. This, they argue, restricts his ability to perform at his absolute best all the time.\n\nThey see his jetting back and forth to the US as a lack of focus and blame it for weekends such as those in Baku and Singapore last year, where Hamilton quite patently, and for reasons that are not clear, just did not bring his 'A game'.\n\nAnd they believe it is facilitated by Mercedes' choice of a team-mate Hamilton knows he can handle.\n\nWolff and Hamilton, meanwhile, insist it is the freedom Mercedes give him to be himself that allows him to perform at his peak - and everyone has a bad day once in a while.\n\nAnd it seems more likely that the 'off' weekends are just part of him, and related to specific aspects of car behaviour, a set-up he cannot get right, or which he refuses to adapt to because he feels it is not working for him.\n\nHis occasional unpredictability is one of the reasons Mercedes need a strong team-mate for Hamilton - and not just to score regular points in the constructors' championship, the main reason Bottas was preferred over Wehrlein.\n\nWhile Rosberg was not on Hamilton's level as a driver, he was close enough to give Mercedes a viable alternative as a counter-balance.\n\nThe likelihood is Bottas will slot in and be - at least - a direct Rosberg replacement. While that is the case, Mercedes might not want a driver with a talent comparable to Hamilton - and the attitude that tends to come with it.\n\nBut if he can't challenge Hamilton regularly, Wolff might, for a number of reasons, wonder whether signing another superstar alongside Hamilton is not such a bad idea after all.\n\nVettel and Alonso, both out of contract at the end of the year, will be watching this with interest.\n\nBottas will go into Mercedes aiming to win races and titles, but he will be as aware as anyone of the challenge facing him.\n\nHamilton will likely already feel emboldened, his position strengthened by Rosberg's departure, and a weaker team-mate would only enhance that feeling.",

She is now hoping to give away part of her liver to a person she may never meet.\n\n\"If I had another spare kidney, I'd do it again,\" Tracey tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.\n\nShe is what is known as an \"altruistic donor\" - someone willing to give away an organ to potentially help save the life of a complete stranger.\n\nA microbiologist in the NHS, and the daughter of two nurses, she has spent her life learning about the importance of healthcare from a professional standpoint.\n\nBut she has also been keen to make a difference on a personal level.\n\n\"I signed up to donate blood, and to the bone marrow register, when I was 18,\" she says.\n\nNow 50, her wish to donate has become gradually more expansive.\n\nIn 2012, she was one of fewer than 100 people that year to donate a kidney without knowing the recipient's identity - and now supports the charity Give A Kidney, encouraging others to do the same.\n\nAs of 30 September 2016, 5,126 people remain on the NHS kidney transplant waiting list.\n\nAbout 3,000 kidney transplants are carried out each year\n\nTracey's kidney donation, in all likelihood, will have saved someone's life.\n\n\"I remind myself of it every day when I wake up,\" she says, rightly proud of her life-changing actions.\n\nIt was not, however, a decision taken on the spur of a moment.\n\nDonating a kidney is an \"involved process\", she says, with suitability assessments taking at least three months to complete.\n\nTests leading up to the transplant include X-rays, heart tracing and a special test of kidney function, which involves an injection and a series of blood tests.\n\n\"It is not something to do if you're scared of needles,\" she jokes.\n\nThe risks associated with donating, however, are relatively low for those deemed healthy enough to proceed, with a mortality rate of about one in 3,000 - roughly the same as having an appendix removed.\n\nCompared with the general public, NHS Blood and Transplant says, most kidney donors have equivalent - or better - life expectancy than the average person.\n\nTracey says she was in hospital for five days after her operation but felt \"back to normal\" within six weeks.\n\nAs well as helping to save lives - including through 80 pints worth of blood donations - Tracey has also helped families create them too.\n\nShe has donated 16 of her eggs, allowing three couples to have children.\n\nIt was a simple decision to take, she says.\n\n\"I have no desire to have children of my own, so I thought, 'I'm healthy, why not?'\"\n\nThe next step, she hopes, could be to donate part of her liver - once again, to someone she has never met. But she is aware of the dangers involved.\n\n\"It's a much riskier operation than donating your kidney,\" she says.\n\nThe rate of death for those donating the right lobe is estimated at one in 200. For the left lobe, it is one in 500.\n\nBut many donators live a long and healthy life, with the organ having an \"amazing capacity to regenerate\", as Tracey describes it.\n\nAlmost immediately after an operation, the remaining liver begins to enlarge in a process known as hypertrophy, continuing for up to eight weeks.\n\nTracey will undoubtedly continue to donate for as long as she can - and is hoping to pass on her organs once she dies.\n\n\"I signed up to donate my brain for medical science when I go,\" she says.\n\nBrain donations are usually performed within 24 hours of death, to be used for medical research into conditions such as dementia.\n\nTaking such decisions can be difficult, but Tracey says her friends and family \"accept I'm going to do what I want to do\".\n\nHer reasons for donating organs - whether it be a brain or a kidney - are both humbling and understated.\n\n\"I think it's part of my nature, my opportunity to do something nice,\" she says.\n\nBut the difference such decisions can make to others is huge.\n\nFor information on how to make a living donation, visit the NHS Blood and Transplant website.\n\nWatch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.",

I just tried to concentrate on the good things I had been doing.\n\n\"Maybe there was a few nerves at the start. No matter how many tournaments you have won, this is an extra buzz.\"\n\nLast month, Fu was 4-1 down before winning eight frames in a row to beat Higgins in the Scottish Open final to claim the third ranking title of his career.\n\nFu added: \"When I am in good form, I handle the mistakes better now. I feel stronger when I miss a few balls, it does not matter to me, I can keep going.\"\n\nI feel sorry for Judd, he did not have a single chance in the final frame but Marco took those last few balls well.\n\nIt was an absolutely wonderful spectacle. Fu is 39 and playing the best snooker of his career.",

We thought fitness might tell - with Wimbledon the fitter side - but the one-man advantage was the major factor.\n\n\"It was a great start for Wimbledon, scoring that early goal, then the Robinson sending-off made it difficult for them. I though Sutton played too many high long balls and lacked creativity round the sides.\n\n\"Wimbledon coped with everything until that late, late surge.\"\n\nWhat the managers said:\n\nSutton manager Paul Doswell spoke of his \"unadulterated joy\" as The U's - 15th in the National League - set-up a home tie with Championship Leeds United.\n\n\"I'm so pleased for my chairman, our directors who are all volunteers, for the 1,000 fans here and for the players.\n\n\"Without being over-emotional about it, we have got a good chance against Leeds on our pitch. No one likes playing on it apart from us it seems. If they make seven or eight changes against us I think we will have a chance.\"\n\nDons boss Neal Ardley meanwhile pointed unsurprisingly to the dismissal of Paul Robinson after 15 minutes as the key moment, though he added he had few complaints with the result.\n\n\"You prepare for the game with 11 men but for most of it we had 10,\" he said. \"Credit to Sutton, they kept going and got their just rewards in the end.\n\n\"But we'll never know what would have happened if it was 11 versus 11.

            "section": "Magazine",
            "content": "Melissa Dohme, from Florida, was 20 years old when she was stabbed more than 30 times and left for dead by her ex-boyfriend. Against all the odds she survived, though she thought she would never have another relationship. But then, as she describes here, she found love in an unexpected place.\n\nBefore the attack I was a college student working full-time in the reception of a local hospital. My dream was to become a nurse.\n\nI was dating Robert Burton, who I had met in high school. We hung out all the time, texting and talking. He was very charming and funny and kind of like a gentle giant.\n\nI noticed his behaviour changed, though, when I started applying to universities. He became very jealous. He would belittle me and not want me to succeed. He would lie about things and if I confronted him he had an explosive temper.\n\nI tried to break up with him but he told me that, as his girlfriend, I should be helping him, not abandoning him. He said he would kill himself if I left him.\n\nMelissa says Robert was funny and kind when they first met\n\nIt escalated to physical abuse. One day in October 2011, I drove us home as he had been drinking. He said that I shut the door before he had finished speaking and that set him off. He started hitting and punching me. I was able to break free and run away to call the police, who arrived and arrested him. He was charged with domestic battery and sentenced to 10 hours in jail. I thought I was finally free of him.\n\nOver the next couple of months he left me alone. I learned through social media that he had another girlfriend, so I really thought he was over me.\n\nThen, on 24 January 2012, he called me at 2am. He had gone to court that morning for the battery charge and said he needed closure from our terrible relationship and just wanted a hug. If I saw him just one more time he said would leave me alone forever.\n\nI didn't listen to my intuition telling me it was wrong, and that was the biggest mistake I ever made. I took my pepper spray and phone, thinking I could protect myself if I needed to.\n\nAs soon as I walked out there he reached his arms out for a hug, but he had a switchblade in his hand. He flipped it open and he started stabbing me over and over again.\n\nI remember the pain of the first few but after that I went into fight-or-flight mode. I tried to fight back and bite his hand. I was punching and screaming and doing everything I could, but I kept falling to the ground because I was losing so much blood.\n\nA young boy and girl nearby ran over because they heard me screaming, and the girl called 911. After seeing them Robert went and got a bigger knife with a serrated blade from his truck and attacked me with that. He had every intention of killing me. He knew the police were going to come and he wanted to get it finished.\n\nHe left me lying in the road and I thought I was going to die. I just prayed to God to save me and give me a chance.\n\nI was drifting away when a police officer shone his light on me. I felt a rush of life come back to me and I was able to state my name and who had attacked me. My speech was very slurred because I had had a stroke from the loss of blood.\n\nMy last few memories were in the ambulance. It was very bright and blurry and people were yelling and trying to stabilise me. They put the ventilator in to help me breathe and I knew that was a really bad sign. I thought, \"OK, they think I'm about to die.\" They then said they needed to airlift me and they called for the helicopter.\n\nI later learned from the trauma surgeons that I died on the table several times and they had to resuscitate me over and over.\n\nMy wounds were severe. I had a broken skull and jaw. My head and nose were fractured. He had severed my facial nerve, so I had paralysis on the right side of my face. They gave me 12 units of blood and the body holds about seven on average. It was a miracle I survived.\n\nThat time in hospital seemed like one very long day, but I was actually in intensive care for several days. At one point I remember motioning for a pen from my family. I needed to know what had happened to my attacker. I couldn't use my right hand because it had been stabbed so many times, so I used my left to write: \"Dead, alive or jail?\"\n\nMy family told me I didn't have to worry, that Robert had been caught and he was not going to harm me now. I felt very relieved.\n\nHe had attempted to kill himself by taking sleeping pills and crashing his car into a wall but he failed. He woke up in hospital strapped to the bed with the police by his side.\n\nI faced a long road to recovery. Nineteen of the 32 stab wounds were to my head, neck and face so I didn't look like myself. I was missing teeth. My hair was shaved because they had to stitch up wounds on my head. Half of my face was paralysed.\n\nWhen I looked in the mirror for the first time afterwards I just sobbed. I was only 20 years old. It was devastating. However, my faith was strong and I knew I wasn't still here on Earth to be mad about what I looked like. I just felt blessed that I was alive.\n\nI had implants in my teeth and my scars slowly faded. I had nerve and muscle surgery in Boston, which helped regenerate my face and give me my smile back. I was keen to get back to school and work as soon as I could.\n\nI assumed I would be single for the rest of my life. I never thought anyone would want to date me because I was damaged and had all this baggage. But I thought I could still use my experiences to help others. I wanted to speak out to let people in abusive relationships know that they deserved to be loved and respected and valued.At one of my speaking events in October 2012 I was delighted to meet the emergency services team who saved my life. One of the firefighters, Cameron, invited my mom and me to go to dinner at the fire department the following week. I was really excited about it.\n\nAfterwards I couldn't stop thinking about Cameron. I knew that I had feelings for him but I was trying to ignore them. I wondered, \"Am I feeling this way because he was one of the firemen who helped me?\" But the more we talked the more we realised we had in common.\n\nHe gave me his number and said, \"You know we're here for you,\" but I thought maybe he was just being nice. Still, I knew I had to see him again so a week later I contacted him and said I had a thank you card for the team. He said I should pop over to the station. I gave them the card and thought I would then leave, but Cameron and I ended up talking for six hours.\n\nIt felt like we could talk forever and that's when it became clear there was something special here.\n\nWe had different dates, we had a barbecue - we love barbecue in southern Florida - and we went to a shooting range. Cameron showed me how to improve my shooting and I now have a concealed-carry permit. It makes me feel better, that I can protect myself.\n\nCameron was by my side in August 2013 when I went to court to face the man who tried to kill me. When it was my turn on the stand Robert was staring at me. He was trying to intimidate me by staring me down but I refused to look away. At the end of the trial when all the evidence was being shown his head went down to the table. He finally had to face what he did and he realised he had no more power.\n\nHe was given life without parole and I was so relieved and thankful. I walked out of there with my life back.\n\nCameron and I continued dating. I went to St Petersburg College but decided not to study nursing - I wanted to dedicate my life to speaking out against domestic violence, so I studied Management and Organisational Leadership in Business.\n\nA couple of years later I was invited to give the first pitch at a Tampa Bay Rays baseball game, in recognition of my work in schools talking about violent relationships.\n\nI was on the mound and there wasn't a baseball there so Cameron came out of the dugout to hand me one. Written on the ball were the words: \"Will you marry me?\"\n\nIt was the most surprising moment of my whole life. And then he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him.\n\nI couldn't speak for a moment as I couldn't find the words. It was just really incredible knowing that he put so much effort in and to making this surprise special for me. And I just I felt very blessed and over the moon. Of course I said yes.\n\nHe gave me a beautiful diamond ring that he had picked out and we're going to get married in a few weeks. All the people that saved me, from the first police officer on the scene to the trauma surgeon, are coming.Today I just feel very blessed to be here. I know that the attack was just one day in my life and it will never define me.\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.",

But the club ended their interest after the Chinese Super League reduced the number of foreign footballers allowed to play.\n\nNew rules stipulate that Chinese clubs will be able to field a maximum of three foreign players per game when the new season starts in March.",

About five mice per hectare would be considered normal, Mr Henry said.\n\nMouse plagues regularly occur only in Australia's grain belts and a province in north-west China, the CSIRO said.\n\nVictoria and South Australia occupy a large part of the Murray-Darling Basin, a fertile region accounting for almost 40% of Australia's agricultural income, according to the government.\n\nOutbreaks of mice create a significant financial hit to farmers who are forced to buy costly bait and often re-sow crops.\n\nMr Henry said outbreaks also led to stress in rural communities.\n\n\"It's the fact that they are invading people's houses, they're in their vehicles, everywhere they turn around there's a mouse,\" he said.\n\n\"People in the cities are aghast when they have a mouse in the house. These people in the country, they're jamming up every crack in their house with steel wool to stop the mice from getting in.\"\n\nMice were introduced to Australia by European settlers. They have few natural predators and face little competition from native wildlife.",

            "content": "On the face of it, on some of the front pages at least, it seems a slam dunk.\n\nBefore Theresa May gives an important speech on Tuesday outlining her plan for the tortuous process of taking us out of the European Union, there has been a big thumbs-up for Brexit (literally- in the picture he had taken with Michael Gove) from the most powerful individual in the world.\n\nOn top of that, Donald Trump, who'll be in charge from Friday, breezily promises a trade deal with the United States that can be sorted out without further ado.\n\nSince the social and diplomatic embarrassments of Nigel Farage's freelance trips to Trump Tower, Number 10 seems to have worked to get the president-elect on board, and his comments in his Times interview to former cabinet minister Michael Gove seem to illustrate success - with the groundwork prepared for a visit between Mr Trump and Mrs May soon after the inauguration.\n\nMr Trump repeated his wholehearted support for the idea of the UK leaving the European Union, and his comments to the Times suggested he would be in the UK's corner. No prime minister would want to make an enemy of an American president, so who wouldn't want an endorsement like this?\n\nBut, as officials in Brussels and leaders around the EU seek to stick together before getting down to business with the talks with the UK, the government may also be wary about being seen to be cosying up too closely to President Trump.\n\nMrs May shares some of his analysis of many voters' disillusionment with what she describes as the \"privileged few\". But the similarities don't run deep, and for voters, Mr Trump appals as much as he inspires.\n\nFor some in Brussels, Mr Trump's support for Brexit may only harden them against the UK. Diplomacy is a sensitive and complicated business, not used to the brashness of this billionaire.\n\nThe European Commission has already piled in to say that it's not possible to make any agreements before the UK has left the EU.\n\nEven Downing Street said today it would \"abide by our obligations\" and committed only to early conversations.\n\nThe president-elect's straightforward promise that a trade deal can be done with Mrs May without delay may come to haunt them both.",

A puppy who swallowed an 8in kitchen knife is recovering after life-saving surgery.\n\nOwner Irene Paisley, 46, from Glasgow, had lost her previous Staffie to cancer just two months earlier and feared the worst for puppy Macie.\n\nShe said: \"Macie was making a squeaking sound - I thought she'd swallowed part of a toy. Then she was sick, but there was no sign of a toy, and she started choking.\n\n\"I was terrified. Poor Macie was still choking and, by the time we arrived at the vet's, there was blood coming out of her nose. The loss of our previous dog was still very raw and the thought of losing Macie was devastating.\"\n\nThe puppy underwent immediate emergency surgery at an out-of-hours vet service in Glasgow to remove the knife while Ms Paisley, her partner and four children waited at home for news.\n\nPDSA vet Emily Ronald, said: \"I've never seen an X-ray like Macie's. She was extremely lucky to survive. Her saving grace was that she swallowed the handle-end first - the blade-end would undoubtedly have pierced her organs, likely causing fatal injuries.\n\n\"The morning after surgery, she was bouncing all over the place as if nothing had happened. Macie has been back for frequent check-ups over the past two weeks and we're pleased she's recovering and healing well.\"\n\nMs Paisley added: \"I couldn't believe it when they said Macie had swallowed a knife. I have no idea where she got hold of it - she could have pinched it out of the dishwasher, but no-one saw what happened. None of us could sleep that night as we knew Macie might not survive.\"\n\nShe added: \"Although she's only young, Macie is already a big part of the family. She brings us so much joy and happiness, and means the world to the children. Without PDSA, she wouldn't have received her life-saving treatment and wouldn't be here today.\"\n\nPDSA provides free veterinary care to sick and injured pets of people in need and promotes responsible pet ownership.\n\nOver the years, the charity's vets have removed items including tent pegs, golf balls, radio aerials and rubber ducks during surgery on pets.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Our voices can tell us more than we think\n\nWe can use them to sing, shout and whisper sweet nothings. We can use them to activate gadgets and prove who we are to banks.\n\nAnd now researchers believe they can also reveal whether we're getting ill.\n\nA US start-up called Canary Speech is developing a way of analysing conversations using machine learning to test for a number of neurological and cognitive diseases, ranging from Parkinson's to dementia.\n\nThe project was born out of a painful personal experience for the firm's co-founder Henry O'Connell.\n\n\"It has been my pleasure to have as a friend for nearly 30 years a dear gentleman who was diagnosed six years ago with Parkinson's disease,\" says Mr O'Connell.\n\n\"My friend was told when the diagnosis was finally made that it was likely that he had been suffering from Parkinson's for over 10 years.\"\n\nAs with so many diseases, early diagnosis can play a crucial role in effectively managing the condition, but recent research highlights the difficulties in correctly diagnosing it, with doctors often struggling to distinguish the symptoms.\n\nAnd the longer the condition goes undiagnosed, the more severe the symptoms become.\n\n\"During the years before his diagnosis was accurately made, my friend, suffering from muscle and apparent nerve-related pain, was treated in several medical facilities,\" says Mr O'Connell.\n\n\"The muscle and nerve-related pain were directly associated with a progressing Parkinson's illness. Because it went undiagnosed, proper treatment was delayed and his Parkinson's progressed potentially more rapidly than it would have under proper diagnosis and treatment.\"\n\nCanary Speech developed algorithms after examining the speech patterns of patients with particular conditions, including Alzheimer's, dementia and Parkinson's.\n\nThis enabled them to spot a number of tell-tale signs both pre and post-diagnosis, including the kinds of words used, their phrasing, and the overall quality of speech.\n\nFor instance, one symptom of the disease is a softening of the voice - something than can be easily overlooked by those close to us. But Canary Speech's software is capable of picking up such small changes in speech patterns.\n\nFellow co-founder Jeff Adams was previously chief executive at Yap, the company bought by Amazon and whose technology subsequently formed the core of the tech giant's voice-activated Echo speaker.\n\nSome studies suggest our speech patterns can give an early indication of Alzheimer's disease\n\nThe overall goal is to be able to spot the onset of these conditions considerably sooner than is currently possible. In initial trials, the software was used to provide real-time analysis of conversations between patients and their clinicians.\n\nAs with so many machine learning-based technologies, it will improve as it gains access to more data to train the algorithms that underpin it.\n\nAnd as more voice-activated devices come on to the market and digital conversations are recorded, the opportunities to analyse all this data will also increase.\n\nSome researchers have analysed conversations between patients and drug and alcohol counsellors, for example, to assess the degree of empathy the therapists were displaying.\n\n\"Machine learning and artificial intelligence has a major role to play in healthcare,\" says Tony Young, national clinical lead for innovation at NHS England.\n\n\"You only have to look at the rapid advancements made in the last two years in the translation space. Machine learning won't replace clinicians, but it will help them do things that no humans could previously do.\"\n\nIt is easy to see how such technology could be applied to teaching and training scenarios.\n\nVoice analysis is also being used in commercial settings.\n\nFor instance, tech start-up Cogito, which emerged from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, analyses the conversations taking place between customer service staff and customers.\n\nThey monitor interactions in real time. Their machine learning software compares the conversation with its database of successful calls from the past.\n\nThe team believes that it can provide staff with real-time feedback on how the conversation is going, together with advice on how to guide things in a better direction - what it calls \"emotional intelligence\".\n\nCogito's software gives real-time tips to customer service staff as they talk to customers\n\nThese tips can include altering one's tone or cadence to mirror that of the customer, or gauging the emotions on display to try to calm the conversation down.\n\nIt's even capable of alerting the supervisor if it thinks that greater authority would help the conversation reach a more positive conclusion. The advice uses the same kind of behavioural economics used so famously by the UK government's Behavioural Insights Team, also known as the Nudge Unit.\n\nEarly customers of Cogito's product, including Humana, Zurich and CareFirst BlueCross, report an increase in customer satisfaction of around 20%.\n\nAs the internet of things spreads its tentacles throughout our lives, voice analysis will undoubtedly be added to other biometric ways of authenticating ourselves in a growing number of situations.\n\nGoogle's Project Abacus, for example, is dedicated to killing passwords, given that 70% of us apparently forget them every month.\n\nIt plans to use our speech patterns - not just what we say but how we say it - in conjunction with other behavioural data, such as how we type, to build up a more reliable picture of our identity. Our smartphones will know who we are just by the way we use them.\n\nThe big - silent - elephant in the room is how all this monitoring and analysis of our voices will impact upon our right to privacy.\n\nFollow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook\n\nClick here for more Technology of Business features\u007f",

Everyone knew that America entering World War One to fight the Germans would help break the stalemate.\n\n\"Yes, my boy. Why?\" Hall answered.\n\n\"I've got something here which - well, it's a rather astonishing message which might do the trick if we could use it,\" de Grey said.\n\nThe previous day, the German foreign minister, Arthur Zimmermann, had sent a message to the German ambassador to Washington.\n\nThe message used a code that had been largely cracked by British code-breakers, the forerunners of those who would later work at Bletchley Park.\n\nNigel de Grey came up with the plan to use the telegram to change the course of World War One\n\nZimmermann had sent instructions to approach the Mexican government with what seems an extraordinary deal: if it was to join any war against America, it would be rewarded with the territories of Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.\n\n\"This may be a very big thing, possibly the biggest thing in the war. For the present, not a soul outside this room is to be told anything at all,\" Hall said after reading it.\n\nPart of the problem was how the message had been obtained.\n\nGerman telegraph cables passing through the English Channel had been cut at the start of the War by a British ship.\n\nSo Germany often sent its messages in code via neutral countries.\n\nGermany had convinced President Wilson in the US that keeping channels of communication open would help end the War, and so the US agreed to pass on German diplomatic messages from Berlin to its embassy in Washington.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. How a decrypted German telegram pushed the United States into World War One and prompted a wave of hostility on the US-Mexico border\n\nThe message - which would become known as the Zimmermann Telegram - had been handed, in code, to the American Embassy in Berlin at 15:00 on Tuesday 16 January.\n\nThe American ambassador had queried the content of such a long message and been reassured it related to peace proposals.\n\nBy that evening, it was passing through another European country and then London before being relayed to the State Department in Washington.\n\nFrom there, it would eventually arrive at the German embassy on 19 January to be decoded and then recoded and sent on via a commercial Western Union telegraphic office to Mexico, arriving the same day.\n\nThanks to their interception capability process, Britain's code-breakers were reading the message two days before the intended recipients (although they initially could not read all of it).\n\nA coded message about attacking the US was actually passed along US diplomatic channels.\n\nAnd Britain was spying on the US and its diplomatic traffic (something it would continue to do for another quarter of a century).\n\nThe cable was intelligence gold-dust and could be used to persuade America to join the War.\n\nBut how could Britain use it - when to do so would reveal both that they were breaking German codes and that they had obtained the message by spying on the very country it was hoping to become its ally?\n\nHall had all the copies locked in his desk while he decided what to do and asked for the rest to be decoded.\n\nLondon was betting that Germany's use of unrestricted submarine warfare - attacking merchant shipping - would be enough to draw America into the War.\n\nAn exhibition at Bletchley Park tells the story of the Zimmermann Telegram\n\nWhen the signs were that an extra push might be needed, it was decided to deploy the Zimmermann Telegram.\n\nRoom 40 asked one of its contacts to get hold of a copy of anything sent to the German embassy in Mexico from the US. This provided another copy of the telegram.\n\nBritain could then plausibly claim this was how it had got hold of the message and get round the problem of admitting it was spying on its friends.\n\nBritain also had to convince the Americans that the message had not been concocted as part of a ruse to get them into the War.\n\nEventually, the US obtained its own copy from the Western Union telegraphic company, and De Grey then decoded it himself in front of a representative at the US embassy in London.\n\nThis meant technically all parties could claim that it had been decoded on US territory.\n\n\"Good Lord,\" President Wilson said when he was told of the details.\n\nThe telegram was then leaked to the American press and published to general amazement on 1 March 1917 (with credit attached to the American Secret Service rather than the British to avoid awkward questions of British manipulation).\n\nWhatever scepticism was left was dispelled when Zimmermann himself took the odd move of confirming he had sent it. A month later, America was in the War.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson took the United States into World War One in April 1917\n\nIt would be too much to claim the Zimmermann Telegram single-handedly brought America into the War.\n\nGermany's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare can take more credit for that.\n\nBut the telegram was useful for convincing the American public that it should be sending its men over to Europe to fight.\n\nThe telegram had proved the perfect justification for a change of policy and to convince some of the sceptics.\n\nIt was, many believed, the single greatest intelligence triumph for Britain in World War One.\n\nIt was also an early sign of the potential impact of intercepting communications, a lesson which the few British and American officials in on the real story were determined to learn from as they set about building their capability.\n\nEarly in World War Two, before America had formally entered the War, it would send a team of its best code-breakers on a clandestine mission to Britain to establish a relationship with their counterparts.\n\nThe Road to Bletchley Park exhibition at the former wartime site features a copy of the Zimmermann Telegram and details of its role.\n\nToday, the two allies have GCHQ and the NSA - two vast intelligence agencies involved in interception and code-breaking.\n\nThey also have a pact which means that - on the whole - they are not supposed to spy on each other.\n\nThe BBC World Service Witness programme recently told the story of how the British managed to intercept the telegram, and heard from some of the code-breakers involved.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",
