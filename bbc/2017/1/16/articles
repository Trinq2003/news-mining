            "description": "Canadian businessman Serge Godin saw his father's business burn down when he was a teenager. That inspired him to build a company that now turns over C$10bn a year.",
            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Serge Godin remembers the event that gave him the drive and determination to succeed in life - watching his father's sawmill burn down.\n\nHe was 17 in Canada at the time, the year was 1966, and as his dad's business was uninsured, the family lost everything.\n\nOne of nine children brought up in rural Quebec, Mr Godin, along with his siblings, suddenly had to earn money to help his parents pay the bills and keep a roof over the family's heads.\n\nSo Mr Godin worked at a supermarket in the evenings after school, and then at a dry cleaner's on Saturdays.\n\nAmbitious to run his own company, in his 20s he used savings of C$5,000 ($3,800; \u00a33,100) to start a computer business that he called Conseillers en Gestion et Informatique (CGI). In English, this translates as Information Systems and Management Consultants.\n\nToday CGI Group is a global IT systems giant that enjoys annual revenues of C$10bn, while Mr Godin's personal fortune is estimated at $1.5bn.\n\nNow 67 years old and the firm's chairman, he says: \"I didn't want to go back to the situation when we lost everything. That's probably what prompted me to build CGI.\"\n\nAfter gaining a computer science degree from Laval University in Quebec City, and a few years working for two companies, Mr Godin launched CGI in 1976, when he was 26.\n\nIn typical computer industry start-up fashion, he began the business from his garage. After a few months on his own, a friend joined the business, and in its first year, CGI generated revenues of C$138,000.\n\nMr Godin is little known outside of Canada, but often features in Canadian papers\n\nFrom that modest start, CGI has grown steadily ever since, fuelled by no fewer than 81 acquisitions, as Mr Godin has continued to follow a policy of ambitious growth.\n\nIn the company's most recent large takeover, it bought its European rival Logica for C$2.7bn in 2012. This more than doubled CGI's workforce, which rose overnight from 31,000 to 68,000.\n\nToday its business clients include companies such as miner Rio Tinto, tyre-maker Michelin, airline group Air France-KLM and London's Heathrow Airport. CGI also does work for 22 of the world's largest banks, and has no fewer than 2,000 government contracts around the world.\n\nMr Godin, who reduced his daily workload in 2006 when he switched from chief executive to chairman, says the business has not given up on fast growth.\n\n\"We think we can double the size of the company [again] within five to 10 years,\" he says.\n\nIt hasn't all been plain sailing for Montreal-based CGI in recent years, however.\n\nBack in 2013, it made headlines for all the wrong reasons, when it was blamed for technical problems that plagued the launch of the US government website where people on low or no income could apply for the new \"Obamacare\" health insurance.\n\nCGI had a central role in building the website, but Mr Godin said at the time that the company \"ended up in the eye of a storm\" between the two main US political parties.\n\nLooking back, he says: \"We stayed and finished the work.\n\n\"We were portrayed by the press as being the system integrator, but we were not. We were one of 52 companies involved in the project.\n\n\"We didn't fight this in the press, because we have a code of ethics and we never criticise our clients.\"\n\nWhile the issue could not have been pleasant at the time, Mr Godin and CGI have always insisted that there was no long-term reputational damage.\n\nIn terms of how CGI is run on a day-to-day basis, Mr Godin says he views it as a big family and that he has to keep everyone happy.\n\n\"At CGI we have a dream, and this dream is centred on the core of our business - our people,\" he says.\n\nThe company floated on the Montreal Stock Exchange in 1986\n\n\"They are the ones who take the elevator to come to work every day, and we have to make sure they will come back and will like working here.\n\n\"As employers, we have rights, but we also have duties towards our employees.\"\n\nOne way in which CGI tries to look after its staff is encouraging them to become shareholders. And for every share that an employee buys, the company will buy him or her the same amount.\n\nMr Godin says: \"This idea of sharing is important to me, because I come from a big family.\"\n\nRobert Young, technology analyst at research group Canaccord Genuity, says: \"Serge Godin is well regarded as the builder of a company with a strong culture and customer relationships.\n\n\"There is a discipline he has baked into the business that is evident in the strong financial controls, and rigorous approach to [what is known as] the 'CGI management foundation' - a set of proven processes and methods that define CGI engagements.\"\n\nWhen not continuing to help lead CGI, Mr Godin focuses on his charity work.\n\nIn 2000, he set up a charitable foundation called Jeunesse-Vie or Youth Life, which aims to help disadvantaged children across Canada through alleviating poverty and improving their education and health. So far, he has given it more than C$60m.\n\nHaving already been inducted into the Canadian Business Hall of Fame, last year he was also recognised for his business and charity work when he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, one of the country's highest civilian honours.\n\nMr Godin says: \"When you have the chance to have a successful business, it is your duty to give back.\"\n\nHe adds: \"My origins remind me that it is important to help.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "section": "Asia",
            "content": "An Afghan woman made famous by a 1985 National Geographic cover has spoken exclusively to the BBC of her hope for a new beginning, after being deported from Pakistan.\n\nSharbat Gula now lives with her five-year-old son and three daughters in Kabul, where she says she wants to live a normal life after years of tragedy and hardship.\n\nHer portrait as a 10-year-old became an iconic image of Afghan refugees fleeing war.\n\nThe only time she has spoken to the media before now, her family says, was for a 2002 documentary after Steve McCurry, who took her original photo, tracked her down in Pakistan and found out who she was.\n\nSharbat Gula had no idea that her face had been famous around the world for almost 17 years.\n\nLike many Afghans, she sought refuge in Pakistan and lived there for 35 years - but she was imprisoned and deported last autumn for obtaining Pakistani identity papers \"illegally\".\n\n\"We had a good time there, had good neighbours, lived among our own Pashtun brothers. But I didn't expect that the Pakistani government would treat me like this at the end,\" Sharbat Gula told me at her temporary residence in Kabul.\n\nHer case highlighted the arbitrary arrest and forced deportation of Afghan refugees in the current spat between the two countries.\n\nIt has been illegal for non-Pakistanis to have IDs since they were first issued in the 1970s, but the law was often not enforced.\n\nNow sick and frail in her mid-40s, Sharbat Gula's haunting eyes are still piercing, full of both fear and hope.\n\nShe says she had already sold her house in Pakistan because she feared arrest there for \"not having proper documents to stay\".\n\nTwo days before a planned move back to Afghanistan, her house was raided late in the evening and she was taken to prison.\n\nSharbat Gula was sentenced to 15 days in prison\n\nPakistan's government has ordered all two million Afghan refugees on its soil to leave.\n\nSharbat Gula believes the Pakistani authorities wanted to arrest her before she left.\n\n\"I told the police that I have made this ID card for only two things - to educate my children and sell my house - which were not possible to do without the ID card.\"\n\nShe served a 15-day prison sentence, the first week in prison and the second in hospital where she was treated for hepatitis C.\n\n\"This was the hardest and worst incident in my life.\"\n\nRealising the reputational damage, Pakistan later offered to let her stay - but she refused.\n\n\"I told them that I am going to my country. I said: 'You allowed me here for 35 years, but at the end treated me like this.' It is enough.\"\n\nHer husband and eldest daughter died in Peshawar and are buried there.\n\n\"If I wanted to go back, it will be just to offer prayer at the graves of my husband and daughter who are buried in front of the house we lived in.\"\n\nThe \"Afghan Girl\" picture was taken by Steve McCurry in 1984 in a refugee camp near Peshawar, when Sharbat Gula was studying in a tent school. Published in 1985, it became one of the most recognisable magazine covers ever printed.\n\nFor years she was unaware of her celebrity.\n\n\"When my brother showed me the picture, I recognised myself and told him that yes, this is my photo.\"\n\n\"I became very surprised [because] I didn't like media and taking photos from childhood. At first, I was concerned about the publicity of my photo but when I found out that I have been the cause of support/help for many people/refugees, then I became happy.\"\n\nSharbat Gula has now returned to Afghanistan, where the government promised her a house in Kabul\n\nNone of Sharbat Gula's six children - another daughter died too at an early age and is buried in Peshawar - share the colour of her eyes.\n\nBut her brother, Kashar Khan, does, and the eyes of one of her three sisters were also green.\n\nShe says her maternal grandmother had eyes of a similar colour.\n\nSharbat Gula was a child living with her family in Kot district of eastern Nangarhar province when Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan in 1979.\n\n\"There was war between Russians and Afghanistan - that is why we left. A lot of damage/destruction was done.\"\n\nHer mother died of appendicitis in the village when she was eight. Like hundreds of thousands of other Afghans, her family (her father, four sisters and one brother) migrated to Pakistan and started living in a tent in a refugee camp called Kacha Garahi, on the outskirts of Peshawar.\n\nShe was married at 13. But her husband, Rahmat Gul, was later diagnosed with hepatitis C and died about five years ago. Her eldest daughter also died of hepatitis three years ago, aged 22, leaving a two-month-old daughter.\n\nSharbat Gula met President Ashraf Ghani in the presidential palace on her return, and later former President Hamid Karzai.\n\n\"They gave me respect, warmly welcomed me. I thank them. May God treat them well.\"\n\nAfghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani received her at the presidential palace\n\nThe government has promised to support her financially and buy her a house in Kabul.\n\n\"I hope the government will fulfil all its promises,\" she told me.\n\nKot district is a stronghold of militants linked to the so-called Islamic State group, so she can't go home to her village. Her green-eyed brother and hundreds of others have fled the area, fearing IS brutality.\n\n\"We cannot even visit our village now because of insecurity and don't have a shelter in Jalalabad. Our life is a struggle from one hardship to another,\" he says.\n\nBut Sharbat Gula's priority is to stay in her country, get better and see her children be educated and live happy lives.\n\n\"I want to establish a charity or a hospital to treat all poor, orphans and widows,\" she says.\n\n\"I would like peace to come to this country, so that people don't become homeless. May God fix this country.\"",

            "section": "US & Canada",
            "content": "The two world leaders may have more in common than meets the eye\n\nAt first glance, few people have less in common than Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and US President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nMr Trudeau is a favourite of global progressives, who see him as a bastion against rising tide of anti-immigrant and protectionist sentiment and who campaigned on appealing to people's \"better angels\".\n\nMr Trump won the US election riding that anti-trade and anti-globalisation wave, and as a political outsider who is free with his insults.\n\nThe relationship between the North American neighbours is a vital one and depends in part on the Republican and Liberal leaders finding common ground, despite differences in personality and policy.\n\nHere are five areas where Mr Trudeau and Mr Trump are somewhat simpatico.\n\n1. They pulled off unexpected election victories after being discounted by rivals and pundits.\n\nPollsters in both countries failed to predict Mr Trudeau and Mr Trump's upsets, and both party leaders were seen as celebrity lightweights by rivals.\n\nIt is a similarity not lost on Mr Trudeau.\n\nIn a 16 December interview with a Montreal radio show host, the prime minister revealed he touched on that \"common ground\" during his congratulatory phone call to Mr Trump following the US election.\n\n\"He and I had a conversation about being knocked around by the media because, present company excluded, that's the experience that I'd had for years of people just slamming me and saying 'he'd never become prime minister,'\" Mr Trudeau said.\n\n2. They embrace politics in the social media age.\n\nThe prime minister and the president-elect both use social media for their political ends.\n\nMr Trudeau and his team know a charming photo opportunity of the photogenic prime minister, from shirtless selfies to yoga poses, can go viral and bolster his popularity at home and abroad.\n\nHe has leveraged social media as a tool to sell his brand of progressive cool to the world.\n\nWhile Mr Trudeau has a healthy Twitter following for a world leader, with nearly 2.4m followers (and over 830,000 on Instagram), his influence on the platform is dwarfed by Mr Trump's 19.7m followers.\n\nA prolific tweeter, Mr Trump wields his influential account to attack opponents, drive the news, and pressure US manufacturers to bend to his agenda.\n\nHe has, however, promised to be more restrained in his Twitter antics after being sworn-in 20 January.\n\n3. They promised to change the way politics is done.\n\nMr Trump vowed during the campaign he would \"drain the swamp\", a catch-all promise for his supporters who see of Washington as a cesspool of lobbyists, corruption, and waste.\n\nDuring the 2015 Canadian election, Mr Trudeau said his predecessor, former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper, \"turned Ottawa into a partisan swamp\" during his near decade in power.\n\nMr Trudeau promised to put an end to partisanship and patronage in Ottawa, to usher in a more transparent and receptive government, and to make question period respectful again.\n\nThe two have faced critics who say those promises were quick to fall by the wayside.\n\nDonald Trump said he would 'Make America great Again'\n\n4. They harkened to the past in their pitch to voters.\n\nThe two politicians pressed some very powerful nostalgia buttons as they campaigned to lead their countries.\n\nMr Trump's inescapable campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again\", borrowed from former US president Ronald Reagan's 1980 race, looked back to a time when voters felt there was more prosperity and opportunity in the United States and when their nation garnered respect on the world stage.\n\nMr Trudeau was more subtle, though his campaign was woven through with a thread of nostalgia, from a promise to recommit troops to overseas peacekeeping efforts to a foreign policy return to when Canadians thought the world saw the country as its good neighbour.\n\nAfter winning the election, Mr Trudeau and his MPs made \"Canada is back\" one of their favourite catchphrases.\n\nPierre Elliott Trudeau, right, Justin Trudeau's father, with former US President Ronald Reagan\n\n5. They followed in their fathers' footsteps.\n\nFred Trump, the first New York real estate magnate in the Trump family, started a million dollar residential real estate business in Brooklyn and Queens.\n\nThe Donald learned the business from his father, switching from building low-income housing in New York City's outer-boroughs to luxury towers in downtown Manhattan.\n\nJustin Trudeau grew up surrounded by politics and was once toasted by former US President Richard Nixon, who predicted the young boy would one day become prime minister like his father Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Trudeau senior served as in that role from 1968 to 1979 and again from 1980 to 1984, becoming one of Canada's most recognisable leaders.\n\u2022 None How has Justin Trudeau's first year gone?",

            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nChelsea's Premier League title rivals thought the door had been pushed ajar after a run on 13 straight wins ended at Tottenham and the new harmony under manager Antonio Conte was disturbed by Diego Costa.\n\nThe title pacesetters would always be able to recover from a bad result - but how would they cope with the exclusion of their firebrand top scorer after a training ground bust-up and suggestions of interest from China?\n\nChelsea gave their answer with an impressive 3-0 win at Leicester City that, combined with the weekend's other results, put them firmly back in control of their Premier League destiny.\n\nSo, after 21 games and another weekend of significant matches, how are the top six clubs shaping up?\n\nConte will have demanded an instant Premier League response from his team after that 2-0 loss at White Hart Lane, which he rightly placed in context by pointing out it was inflicted by a quality side with title aspirations of their own.\n\nThe wildcard was provided by the sudden falling out with influential striker Costa that provided an unexpected backdrop to Saturday's events at the King Power Stadium and gave the first hint of dissent in Chelsea and Conte's camp this season.\n\nIn the end, the Italian boss was given the opportunity to prove the versatility and flexibility of his squad in Costa's absence as Willian, Eden Hazard and Pedro provided the attacking threat.\n\nIn the absence of any suggestion Blues owner Roman Abramovich will bow to pressure to sell in January, the priority now is to get the combustible Spain striker back on side and ensure any unrest does not spread.\n\nIf that can be done, then Chelsea can look back at a weekend where their title position was strengthened as they now stand seven points clear.\n\nMauricio Pochettino's side are a growing force in this title race and the 4-0 demolition of West Bromwich Albion was further evidence of their growing authority.\n\nIt was their sixth straight league win since their loss at Manchester United in December - and they have only lost two games out of 21.\n\nHarry Kane is firing on all cylinders, shown by his hat-trick against West Brom, and with Dele Alli scoring seven goals in his past five league games Spurs are starting to look the full package.\n\nThey ran out of steam towards the end of last season, but Pochettino is a top-class operator who will surely have learned his lesson and tailored his team's intense style accordingly.\n\nThe Argentine will still hope to avoid injuries and there is a real worry over influential defender Jan Vertonghen, who Pochettino fears has suffered a \"bad\" ankle injury.\n\nNext weekend's game at Manchester City will tell us even more about them.\n\nVerdict: Flew under the radar for a while but now right at the heart of the title race.\n\nLiverpool will be disappointed they could not hold on for victory at Manchester United on Sunday, but there is plenty of encouragement to take from their performance.\n\nThe disappointment will come because they were within six minutes of securing a win that would not only have inflicted even more damage on United, but also would have sent a strong message to those nearer the top of the table.\n\nIt is to the Reds' credit that they came so close to victory despite key men such as Philippe Coutinho still not fit enough to start, Nathaniel Clyne out with a rib injury and Joel Matip sidelined because of confusion surrounding his absence from Cameroon's Africa Cup Of Nations squad.\n\nManager Jurgen Klopp rightly believes they are still in a strong position but will surely be frustrated that Zlatan Ibrahimovic's late goal means Chelsea stretched their advantage to seven points.\n\nVerdict: Remain title contenders but top four would still be fine achievement.\n\nArsenal's win at Swansea City could not have been more convincing and they have responded well to successive losses at Everton and Manchester City, when they conceded winning positions and showed the vulnerability that has haunted them for seasons.\n\nEven at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday they made a slow start, but it is hard to argue with a 4-0 away win.\n\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger wants the Gunners to stay in the title shake-up until the closing stages - and they are certainly doing that so far.\n\nAre they, however, potential Premier League winners? They cannot be ruled out but it is hard to see where they will pick up the points to haul in Chelsea.\n\nVerdict: In the mix as their manager demands, but will a soft centre let them down?\n\nForm: Two defeats in past three.\n\nManager Pep Guardiola effectively wrote off Manchester City's title challenge after they were giving a thorough working over and beaten 4-0 at Everton.\n\nCity now face a fight to finish in the top four with a side seemingly physically weak, riddled with defensive frailty and a goalkeeper in Claudio Bravo who hardly ever seems to save a shot. Failure to make next season's Champions League would represent a catastrophe in the Spaniard's first season.\n\u2022 None MOTD2 analysis: Why defending is not Pep's only problem\n\nAnd this is Guardiola's responsibility after he shipped out England keeper Joe Hart on loan to Torino. Out of the past 22 shots Bravo has faced, 14 have been goals.\n\nOnly five teams have a lower haul than City's tally of four clean sheets and they have conceded from the first shot they have faced in four of their past seven games.\n\nThe problems are there for all to see, although Guardiola has so far done little to correct the faults.\n\nCity have suffered two damaging defeats on Merseyside in recent weeks - and do not look like a side who have the slightest chance of making up a 10-point deficit on Chelsea.\n\nVerdict: Forget the title. Manchester City are in a top-four fight now.\n\nManchester United are showing definite signs of improvement under manager Jose Mourinho, but like neighbours City their fight is now for the top four rather than the title.\n\nThey could have closed to within two points of Liverpool with victory at Old Trafford on Sunday, but 12 points is surely an impossible gap to breach between United and Chelsea.\n\nUnited have drawn seven league games - including five at home - and the simple fact is they have squandered too many points to make up the deficit.\n\nMourinho is definitely moving United forward, but not fast enough to make them title contenders this season.\n\nVerdict: Top four should be the target. The title is now out of reach.",

This new job has no holidays and no regular working hours at all.\n\n\"I have had numerous opportunities to work abroad but I declined them so I could be a part of my daughter's life as she grows up.\n\n\"I've decided to quit my new job, and today after just two months I'm leaving.\n\n\"Now I'm looking to start a business where I can spend more time with my family.\"\n\nJessica: \"My husband and I made the decision when our son was born that I should work full time and he would work part time and be the stay-at-home parent. This is because, as a woman, I get far more rights as a working mother than he would as a working father.\n\n\"I am entitled to flexible working and have more legal rights. I work 36 hours a week and he works between 16 and 18, split over a Friday afternoon and Sunday afternoon which means we are at home together on a Saturday and our son only has to go to a nursery for one afternoon a week.\n\n\"It's been eight months and it's working so far. Dan is happy because he is at home with our son and also has a job so he feels like he is contributing to our income and Louis (our son) is happy because he has a parent at home during the week.\n\n\"We earn enough to get by and get no help from the state with our son other than child benefit.\"\n\n\"In my role, it's really hard to find a healthy work-life-balance. In a lot of companies you will get benefits, such as salary increase based on the effort you invest into your job. If you are not focused on your career, then you will get no increase or not the amount that would be needed.\n\n\"If you are focused just on your career you will miss beautiful moments with your child.\n\n\"If you would like to spend more time taking care of your child, you have to work hard. Then it becomes a circle, like an infinite loop, that you cannot close.\n\n\"Some people advise to either not work that hard or to move to another company, but this is nonsense. Why? Because your family needs money. More money comes from higher appreciation at work. This comes from more hard work. However, it will also reduce the time you have for your family.\n\n\"In addition, the parental leave we have here in Hungary is near to nothing. We get two days of parental leave per year per child, which is not enough. Salary increases are also not a trend here, at least not in my case.\"\n\n\"I jumped off the career ladder about five or six years ago - a decision taken with my wife to effectively swap roles; she'd worked part-time since the first of our two sons was born.\n\n\"She wanted to get back to her career, and I was painfully aware of missing out on being around my boys. We had enough cash to fall back on that my not working for a while wouldn't cause problems and then I started working part-time from home as a writer.\n\n\"There are a lot of unexpected barriers and challenges when you're a stay-at-home dad - they almost all boil down to other people's attitudes.\n\n\"It's important to accept that balance comes at a cost.\"\n\n\"When the time came that I wanted to get back to work I met some almost hostile responses. Many people struggled to accept that a man would want to spend more time at home with his kids for a while.\n\n\"I asked a few of them 'would you be so negative in the face of a woman returning to work after a prolonged child-related career break?' The answer was always 'no' and was often followed by an uncomfortable acceptance that they were regarding me differently solely because of my gender.\n\n\"It's a real eye-opener into tacit acceptance of gender-defined roles in society. That's something facing both men and women and it needs to change.\n\n\"These days I work as a copywriter for a marketing agency. I spend three days in the office and two days at home. It feels like a good balance. But it's important to accept that balance comes at a cost.\n\n\"I earn about a third less than I did about six years ago and half what I might be earning had I stayed on the career ladder. But it's definitely been worth it.\"\n\n\"Nearly three years ago I changed jobs. I took a pay cut purely for the reason of getting a better work-life balance and importantly to spend more time with my two kids. It is a move that I have not regretted.\n\n\"Previously the stress levels I was working under were making me ill. The previous job also was further away from home, so I was spending between three-and-a-half to four hours travelling every day.\n\n\"My wife and I both still work full time - we could not afford the mortgage otherwise. Life is still a struggle, but we get by.\n\n\"Family is so much more important than a career.\"\n\n\"The family have breakfast together every morning now. I can now see that my kids leave home to get on the bus to school before I travel to work. I work one day a week from home and that also is invaluable.\n\n\"It means I can help with things like getting the kids to and from after-school activities - both my children are members of the local swimming club and train for around 10 hours a week.\n\n\"Family is so much more important than a career. My new employer, Virgin Media, has been good to me.\"\n\n\"I have struggled with this for many years, choosing to be paid at 80% while working 100%. I forego a larger salary for the right to look my colleagues in the eye when I'm leaving early two afternoons a week to meet the school bus.\n\n\"Yet as a manager, my commitment and my ability to manage has been called into question a few times. 'Why don't you get an au pair?' I've been asked. Or 'why don't you ask your wife to work less?'\n\n\"As a man, I know the expectations on men can be tough when we want to step out of a stereotype.\"\n\n\"I think this is a very important area for the UK to improve. My daughter was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia and Canadian law is much more even-handed.\n\n\"At the time my wife was self-employed and so I was able to take our entire allocation of parental leave. This allowed me to be there full time for my daughter for the first eight months of her life.\n\n\"I also had the great fortune to be working for a very enlightened employer whose policy topped up my state allowance to 95% of my salary.\n\n\"To say this was the most important and precious time of my life is an understatement. It allowed my wife and I to fully share the role of parenting and I feel we are much stronger as a family as a result.\n\n\"As a middle manager I was the first man to take advantage of this at my job and contrary to complaining and worrying about how they would cope, my bosses were more concerned with baby showers. I felt totally supported.\n\n\"What did the employer get out of this? A whole lot of loyalty and an employee that worked hard happily, who dealt with personnel issues with compassion and empathy and a very low staff turnover rate. All intangible I know, but as an employer, if you go to bat for your employees, they will do the same for you.\"\n\n\"Living and working in the Middle East has posed even larger issues with work-life balance.\n\n\"With the constant drive to meet deadlines, as well as meeting client expectations, work-life balance is generally not taken into account by bosses.\n\n\"Due to ensuring that the clients are kept happy and that revenue is maximised, it is rare that I and a lot of others in this part of the world are allowed to take more than two weeks leave at a time, even though by law we are entitled to four weeks a year paid vacation.\n\n\"Due to the excessive client expectations, six-day working weeks are the norm so getting time to spend with your family is far and few between, to the extent that I will pull a sickie if I know my kid, wife or both have an impromptu day off (my wife is a teacher and my kid is in nursery).\n\n\"I'm constantly looking for work outside the Middle East that offers a better working schedule so I can spend time with my family.\"",

The on-court temperature was in the high 30s, which wasn't easy.\n\nI didn't feel any extra pressure playing my first Grand Slam as the world number one. I felt nervous beforehand, but I get that before all Slams.\n\nI always feel that bit of extra nerves and bit of extra pressure because these are the tournaments that often you work towards. They're the biggest tournament for tennis players. It would be a bad sign if you weren't coming in nervous so I treat it as a good sign.\n\nBeing nervous shows me that I want to play well and that I'm up for it. Normally nerves tend to make me feel better or play better but I found it tough on Monday in harsh conditions.\n\nThe crowd were good. Sometimes in day sessions, when it's hot as it was, it's not easy for people to sit out in the sun for that long. There was a great atmosphere and lot of people out there watching.\n\nAfter I was knighted I was asked if I wanted to be known as Sir Andy, from whether it was in the draws and on the scoreboards to when I was getting announced.\n\nI'm happy with just plain old Andy, though.\n\nIt was an amazing honour to receive, although I have had some mickey-taking with some of the players about calling me 'Sir', especially the ones that have known me for a long time.\n\n'It helps having family here'\n\nIn Grand Slams, if you go through to the end, you have two weeks of tennis with a day off after every match.\n\nKim and Sophia are here with me in Australia and it helps. It's nice to have them here and take my mind off the tennis when the matches are done.\n\nI have a lot of family here: Kim's mum is also here, as is Jamie and my mum. In the morning we can have breakfast together as a family and then in the evening, when I get back from practice, Sophia is starting to get ready for bed.\n\nSo sadly it means I don't get to do a lot of the fun stuff with them during the day.\n\n'I didn't get the dogs anything for Christmas'\n\nI flew to Australia after being able to have Christmas with my family. My first Christmas as a father was good, but busy.\n\nA lot of Christmases I have been away or at training, so it was good to be able to see Sophia on Christmas Day.\n\nI spent the morning with my wife and daughter and Kim's family, then I flew at midday up to Scotland and had lunch with my mum's side of my family. Then in the evening I went to my dad's to have dinner with his family. It was a busy day and I did all right with presents too.\n\nI didn't get the dogs anything this Christmas. My wife normally gets them toys and presents, and they get sent lots of stuff from my mum and my grandparents. They do pretty well, but they are just as happy tearing into the wrapping paper on Christmas Day.",

The Daily Telegraph claims the deal will make Mr Hunt \"the richest member of the cabinet\".\n\nJeremy Hunt set to receive a \u00a315m windfall is \"politcally embarrassing\" says the Times\n\nMeanwhile the Daily Mail's lead story highlights what it calls \"the scale of abuse of the crumbling NHS by health tourists\".\n\nIt claims a hospital in Luton is attempting to recoup \u00a3350,000 from a Nigerian woman, who is said to have flown to Britain to give birth to twins.\n\nThe cancer specialist, Professor Meirion Thomas, tells the paper that similar, \"staggering\" debts should be investigated by NHS fraud officers, as \"patients don't arrive at specialist hospitals with serious illnesses by chance\".\n\nThe Sun says the half-brother of Prince Harry's American girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has apologised after he was arrested for alleged gun offences in the US. Thomas Markle Jr blamed the incident on a drunken argument, prompting the headline \"Soz Sis! I was so sozzled\".\n\nThe Daily Mail says other members of the family have insisted the arrest will not cause problems for Ms Markle's relationship with Prince Harry, but the Daily Express claims there is \"some concern\" in royal circles.",

            "section": "Magazine",
            "content": "Johanna and Scott Watkins pictured together before she became severely allergic to her husband\n\nTwenty-nine-year-old Johanna Watkins from Minnesota cannot kiss her husband Scott, or even spend time in the same room as him. She suffers from Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, a rare disorder of the immune system, which means she is allergic to almost everything, including her husband's scent.\n\nJohanna and Scott Watkins's date nights are very different from other couples.\n\n\"Scott and I will try to watch a show together. We can't be in the room together, because I'm allergic to him, but he will be three floors below me in a room on his laptop and I will be on mine and we'll watch the show at the same time and then text about it as we're watching it,\" says Johanna.\n\nJohanna lives in an attic room all by herself with sealed windows and doors, and air filters to purify the air. She has a severe form of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) in which the cells that are meant to protect her from outside threats mutate and start attacking her body instead.\n\nOn their wedding day the couple were unaware Johanna's condition would become so severe\n\nThe symptoms and severity of the disease can vary from patient to patient, but it makes Johanna allergic to virtually everything and can trigger life-threatening anaphylactic shock.\n\nBefore she married her husband Scott in 2013 Johanna did not expect her condition to become so severe. She worked as a teacher and the couple used to love hiking together. Even then she struggled with unusual rashes, irritable bowel syndrome and migraines, but these ailments became much worse after the couple married.\n\n\"There were times three and four years ago, before we got the diagnosis, that if I was extra close to my wife, specifically if my face was close to Johanna's face, she would cough,\" says Scott.\n\nBut it was only last year that the couple realised they had become unable to physically share their life together.\n\n\"We had noticed that when Scott would come in [to the room] I would start feeling worse and worse. My normal daily symptoms would just be aggravated,\" says Johanna. \"And then at one point he went to get his haircut and came back in the room and within two minutes I had started my anaphylactic symptoms and he had to leave.\"\n\nA week later Scott tried to see his wife again, but the same thing happened, and they realised their lives would have to change dramatically.\n\n\"It was this horrible reality that it wasn't going to work,\" says Johanna. \"I was now reacting strongly to my husband. Before this I had reacted to my parents, to many, many other people, but it was horrific when it became Scott.\"\n\nThe treatment and medication that is usually given to MCAS sufferers does not help Johanna, so at the moment the couple do not know when - if ever - their situation will change.\n\n\"There's not an easy way around this problem. I want to keep Johanna safe and me going to see her compromises her safety,\" says Scott. \"One of the ways I can take care of her now is by not going to see her. I'm not going to endanger her life. We're absolutely committed to one another and we're going to wait as long as it takes to see if there is some kind of healing.\"\n\nDoctors are trying different treatments, but none so far have helped.\n\n\"They don't know if I will get well, and so we hope and we pray that I will,\" says Johanna. \"I have had anaphylaxis, which is a life-threatening allergic reaction, more times than we can keep track of. My life could end quickly. Life is frail - it can end.\"\n\nBut Scott will be part of her life for as long as it continues, she says.\n\n\"On our wedding day we made vows to each other that till death do us part. No matter what life brought.\n\n\"I can tell you that even if I have this until I'm 90 years old, I would be committed to my husband with that vow and still love him.\"\n\nJohanna and Scott are no longer able to hold each other's hands\n\nScott says they do sometimes get angry and frustrated about their situation.\n\n\"I've had to release a lot of what I expected for myself and I've had to accept what has been given to us,\" says Scott.\n\nHe adds: \"Johanna and I are good at talking, we talk a lot, we try to communicate a lot, so one thing that we've found that's helpful is just bringing each other into what's going on in our lives as best we can because we're not able to be together.\"\n\nScott works full-time as a teacher and then returns home every evening to cook Johanna's food.\n\n\"It's one of the ways that I can care for her, and every other day for the past year I've had one of my dear friends come and they help [me] cook for Johanna,\" he says. \"She can only eat two meals, so she's been eating the same two meals for over a year.\"\n\nJohanna can only tolerate 15 different foods, including spices, so she eats either beef chuck roast (beef stew) with organic celery, carrot and parsnip or organic lamb with turmeric, cinnamon and cucumber.\n\nJohanna has not responded to any treatment so far, including four rounds of chemotherapy\n\nThe couple are currently living in the family home of their friends, the Olsons, while their own home is renovated to make it a safe living space for Johanna. The Olson family have given up using all scented products and do not cook in their house at all.\n\n\"I have had severe reactions to someone smoking a cigarette down the block,\" says Johanna. \"I have had severe reactions to the pizza place that's a mile down the street, and all my windows are closed and sealed in the room with special filters.\n\n\"But just if the wind blows it on the right direction that day and I get even a whiff I can have a severe reaction. The house is quite large and I'm at the top level, and if an onion were to be cut in the kitchen I have had a severe reaction.\"\n\nJohanna has not left the attic room for more than a year, except to visit the hospital in an emergency or to see her doctor. Every morning she listens to a playlist of songs and then might write or answer an email to a friend, or video-call her young nieces.\n\nThe only people she does not have a life-threatening reaction to are her siblings, who help take care of her. Before they enter her room, they have to avoid eating strongly spiced food, shower with a special soap and strip down to their underwear. As soon as they walk in, they put on masks and special clothes that have never left Johanna's room.\n\nDespite all these precautions, Johanna's symptoms still become worse after their visit.\n\n\"I think growing up in America, it's common for us to just think, 'Oh OK if there's a disease there'll be a medical solution, it will be fixed and I'll move on with my life,'\" says Johanna. \"So being diagnosed and becoming this ill, [there was] definitely a grieving process that I went through.\"\n\nBut the fact that Scott is downstairs in the same house and that she can talk to him on the phone is a huge comfort, says Johanna.\n\n\"I have many gifts in my life, many blessings that I have to be thankful for,\" she says. \"And that reminds me to not become selfish and just make it all about me.\"\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.",

When it's like that, the ball is bouncing a bit lower and it is a bit easier to control. I was a bit tentative because of that.\n\n\"And I didn't serve that well either. So you end up having to work really hard on a lot of your service games when it's like that.\"\n\nIt was a very hot afternoon and therefore I think you could say Murray expended a little more energy than he would wish.\n\nHis first serve will be a concern - it can't be easy serving in the sun - but the heat is not really a huge factor for him.\n\nAll in all, he looked in pretty good spirits. I don't think he'll be hugely concerned but there are things to work on.\n\nBedene, ranked 108 in the world, was 5-2 up in the opener but Estrella Burgos took the first two sets.\n\nThe Slovenia-born Briton eased through the third set, but Estrella Burgos progressed after three hours and nine minutes.",

            "content": "The question of whether Russia's leader Vladimir Putin has got material with which he could blackmail Donald Trump is for now unknowable and misses the point by a country mile: the two men think alike.\n\nMr Trump's belief in American traditionalism and dislike of scrutiny echo the Kremlin's tune: nation, power and aversion to criticism are the new (and very Russian) world order.\n\nYou could call this mindset Trumputinism.\n\nThe echo between the Kremlin and Trump Tower is strong, getting louder and very, very good news for Mr Putin.\n\nAs Trump signalled to Michael Gove on Monday, a new nuclear arms reduction deal seems to be in the offing linked to a review of sanctions against Russia.\n\nThe dog that did not bark in the night is Mr Trump's peculiar absence of criticism of Mr Putin, for example, on the Russian hacking of American democracy, his land-grab of Crimea and his role in the continuing war in Eastern Ukraine.\n\nWhat is odd is that Mr Trump, in his tweets, favours the Russia line over, say, the CIA and the rest of the American intelligence community.\n\nBut why on earth criticise the world leader with whom you most agree?\n\nThree men have egged along Trumputinism: Nigel Farage, who is clear that the European Union is a far bigger danger to world peace than Russia; his friend, Steve Bannon, who is now Mr Trump's chief strategist; and a Russian \"penseur\", Alexander Dugin.\n\nWith his long hair and iconic Slavic looks, Mr Dugin is variously described as \"Putin's Brain\" or \"Putin's Rasputin\".\n\nAlexander Dugin is described as \"Putin's Brain\"\n\nHe has his own pro-Kremlin TV show which pumps out Russian Orthodox supremacy in a curious mixture of Goebbels-style rhetoric and Songs of Praise.\n\nMr Dugin is widely believed to have the ear of the Kremlin.\n\nHe is also under Western sanctions for the ferocity of his statements in favour of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has cost 10,000 lives to date.\n\nMessrs Farage, Bannon and Dugin are all united that the greatest danger for Western civilisation lies in Islamist extremism.\n\nMr Bannon aired his views in a right-wing mindfest on the fringes of the Vatican in 2014.\n\nHe claimed that so-called Islamic State has a Twitter account \"about turning the United States into a 'river of blood'\".\n\n\"Trust me, that is going to come to Europe,\" he added. \"On top of that we're now, I believe, at the beginning stages of a global war against Islamic fascism.\"\n\nThe danger is that in allying yourself with the Kremlin in the way they fight \"Islamist fascism\" in say, Aleppo, you end up siding with what some have called \"Russian fascism\" or, at least, abandoning democratic values and the rules of war and, in so doing, become a recruiting sergeant for ISIS.\n\nIt is a risk on which Mr Dugin does not seem willing to reflect. My interview with him in Moscow did not end well.\n\nDugin posted a critical blog entry after walking out of his interview with John Sweeney\n\nFirst, he dismissed the chances that the Russians hacked American democracy as \"strictly zero\".\n\nI asked him about the depth of Mr Putin's commitment to democracy.\n\n\"Please be careful,\" he responded. \"You could not teach us democracy because you try to impose to every people, every state, every society, their Western, American or so-called American system of values without asking\u2026and it is absolutely racist; you are racist.\"\n\nToo many of Mr Putin's critics end up dead - around 20 since he took power in 2000.\n\nI have met and admired three: Anna Politkovskaya, Natasha Estemirova and Boris Nemtsov.\n\nBoris Nemtsov was murdered close to the Kremlin in 2015\n\nMr Nemtsov was shot just outside the Kremlin's walls.\n\nI asked Mr Dugin what his death told us about Russian democracy.\n\n\"If you are engaged in Wikileaks you can be murdered,\" he countered.\n\nI then invited Mr Dugin to list the American journalists who have died under Barack Obama.\n\nMr Dugin did not oblige but told me that ours was a \"completely stupid kind of conversation\" and walked out of the interview.\n\nLater, he posted a blog to his 20,000 followers, illustrated with my photograph and accusing me of manufacturing \"fake news\" and calling me \"an utter cretin... a globalist swine\".\n\nSuch is the language of the new world order.\n\nA few days later I watched the press conference when Mr Trump closed down a question from a CNN reporter by accusing him of manufacturing \"fake news\".\n\nUnder Trumputinism, the echo between Russia and America is getting louder by the day.\n\nPanorama: The Kremlin Candidate?

            "section": "Africa",
            "content": "Owning a car for many Ethiopians - even those with ready cash to spend in one of the world's fastest-growing economies - remains a pipe dream.\n\n\"I have been saving for nearly four years now, and I still can't afford to buy even the cheapest vehicle here,\" a frustrated Girma Desalegn tells me.\n\nHe has been shopping around for a whole week in capital, Addis Ababa, and has still not found an affordable car.\n\nHe is looking to buy a second-hand car imported from the Gulf states or Europe - but even they are prohibitively expensive because the government classifies cars as luxury goods.\n\nThis means even if a vehicle is second hand, it will be hit with import taxes of up to 200%.\n\n\"I have a budget of $15,000 (\u00a312,300) and had expected that with that I could buy a decent family car.\n\n\"I don't want to buy the Toyota Vitz,\" he says pointing to a row of small hatchbacks that have now become popular on Ethiopian roads.\n\nThese cost about $16,000 in Ethiopia; in neighbouring Kenya the same car costs not more than $8,000.\n\nIt seems little wonder that Ethiopia has the world's lowest rate of car ownership, with only two cars per 1,000 inhabitants, according to a 2014 Deloitte report.\n\nHenok Demessew, who has been running a car import and sales business in the capital, blames taxation.\n\n\"If it was not for that, we would have been able to import better cars either from Europe or America. But in order to make any profits we have to sell cars at such high prices.\n\n\"On top of the cost of shipping the cars from say from Dubai via Djibouti, we have to deal with multiple taxes to the government, making this one of the toughest businesses to be in, even though it's seen as lucrative.\"\n\nThe Ethiopian Revenues and Customs Authority says both commercial and private vehicles imported into the country can be subjected to five different types of taxes.\n\nHowever, despite the heavy tax burden there is a rise in the numbers of car imports.\n\nIn 2016, government records show that 110,000 cars were imported to Ethiopia, an increase of more than 50% on the previous two years.\n\nVehicles to be used for public transport are exempt from some import taxes\n\nKasaye Ayele, a tariff officer at the customs authority, says there is some discretion.\n\n\"Vehicles that are imported to be used for public transport - we collect a much lower tax of 10% and not all five taxes are applied,\" he explains.\n\n\"But for private cars we check the engine capacity and if the capacity is big, we collect anything between 60% and 100% [of taxes due].\"\n\nOnce all taxes are added to an imported car's price tag, it could cost nearly three times more than the retail price in its country of origin.\n\nBut Mr Kasaye defends the taxation policy, saying it was fair and staggered. He cites examples of discounts given for buying second-hand cars.\n\nIn a bid to encourage people to buy cheaper, locally made cars, the Ethiopian government has given incentives such as tax breaks to foreign car manufacturers to set up and assemble new vehicles in the country.\n\nCurrently Ethiopia produces 8,000 commercial and private vehicles for the local market a year - something the government admits is way below the country's potential.\n\nPrime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn has often pointed out plans for Ethiopia to become a leading manufacturer and exporter of locally made cars.\n\nAt least half a dozen car assembly plants, mostly Chinese, have been set up in Ethiopia.\n\nOne of them is Lifan Motors, which was set up nearly seven years ago. One of its cheapest saloon models costs about $20,000 new.\n\nIt has a plant on the outskirts of the Addis Ababa which assembles about 1,000 cars a year - way below its capacity.\n\nFor the company's deputy manager, Ma Qun, this is down to a lack of confidence in the local market from consumers.\n\nThose who can afford imported brands, will choose them over local cars - despite the high taxes charged on used cars, he says.\n\n\"We are not satisfied. Our factory's capacity is about 5,000 a year but we sell just 1,000 units.\n\n\"It's because the policy doesn't restrict second-hand cars. So there aren't really many incentives for us to compete.\n\n\"We are waiting to see if there will be a change in the policy.\"\n\nFor many Ethiopian car buyers it comes down to value for money.\n\n\"We often prefer imported cars because we believe they are much better than the Chinese assembled here,\" one prospective buyer said.\n\n\"On top of that, people don't trust cars assembled locally because what we import from China are not up to a standard quality.\"\n\nAnother pointed out concerns about spare parts for locally assembled cars.\n\n\"Those you usually find around here are not genuine. That is the major reason people prefer Japanese cars.\"\n\nBut the government is highly unlikely to change its luxury tax on foreign cars.\n\nSo for people like Mr Girma, who wants a big, reliable car for his family, it remains a Catch-22 situation and his search will continue.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Nearly 20 years ago, poor families in Coahuila state in Mexico were offered an unusual handout from a social programme called Piso Firme. It was not a place at school, a vaccination, food, or even money. It was $150 (\u00a3118) worth of ready-mixed concrete.\n\nWorkers would drive concrete mixers through poor neighbourhoods, stop outside a home, and pour the porridge-like mixture through the door, right into the living room.\n\nThey showed the occupants how to spread and smooth the gloop, and made sure they knew how long to leave it to dry. Then they drove off to the next house.\n\nPiso Firme means \"firm floor\", and when economists studied the programme, they found that the ready-mixed concrete dramatically improved children's education.\n\n50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world we live in.\n\nIt is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.\n\nPreviously, the floors were made of dirt, which let parasitic worms thrive, spreading diseases that stunted kids' growth and made them miss school.\n\nConcrete floors are much easier to keep clean. So the kids were healthier, and their test scores improved. Economists also found that parents in the programme's households became happier, less stressed and less prone to depression.\n\nThat seems to be $150 well spent.\n\nBeyond the poor neighbourhoods of Coahuila state, concrete often has a less wonderful reputation.\n\nIt has become a byword for ecological carelessness: concrete is made of sand, water and cement, and cement takes a lot of energy to produce. The production process also releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.\n\nThat might not be such a problem in itself - after all, steel production needs a lot more energy - except that the world consumes absolutely vast quantities of concrete: five tonnes, per person, per year. As a result, the cement industry emits as much greenhouse gas as aviation.\n\nArchitecturally, concrete implies lazy, soulless structures: ugly office blocks for provincial bureaucrats, multi-storey car parks with stairwells that smell of urine.\n\nPortsmouth's Tricorn Centre was regularly described as the UK's ugliest building, before its demolition\n\nYet it can also be shaped into forms that many people find beautiful - think of the Sydney Opera House or Oscar Niemeyer's Brasilia cathedral.\n\nPerhaps it is no surprise that concrete can evoke such confusing emotions.\n\nThe very nature of the stuff feels hard to pin down. \"Is it stone? Yes and no,\" opined the great American architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1927. \"Is it plaster? Yes and no. Is it brick or tile? Yes and no. Is it cast iron? Yes and no.\"\n\nHowever, the fact that it is a great building material has been recognised for millennia - perhaps even since the dawn of human civilization.\n\nThere is a theory that the very first settlements, the first time that humans gathered together outside their kinship groups - nearly 12,000 years ago at Gobekli Tepe in southern Turkey - was because someone had figured out how to make cement, and therefore concrete.\n\nOscar Niemeyer's Brasilia Cathedral was constructed from 16 concrete columns, each weighing 90 tonnes\n\nIt was certainly being used over 8,000 years ago by desert traders to make secret underground cisterns, some of which still exist in modern day Jordan and Syria. The Mycenaeans used it over 3,000 years ago to make tombs you can see in the Peloponnese in Greece.\n\nThe Romans were also serious about the stuff.\n\nUsing a naturally occurring cement from volcanic ash deposits at Puteoli, near Pompeii and Mount Vesuvius, they built their aqueducts and their bathhouses with concrete.\n\nWalk into the Pantheon in Rome, a building that will soon celebrate its 1,900th birthday. Gaze up at what was the largest dome on the planet for centuries, arguably until 1881.\n\nYou're looking at concrete. It is shockingly modern.\n\nMany Roman brick buildings are long gone - but not because the bricks themselves have decayed. They've been taken apart, cannibalised for parts. Roman bricks can be used to make modern buildings.\n\nBut the concrete Pantheon? One of the reasons it has survived for so long is because the solid concrete structure is absolutely useless for any other purpose.\n\nBricks can be reused, concrete cannot. It can only be reduced to rubble. And the chances of it becoming rubble depend on how well it is made.\n\nBad concrete - too much sand, too little cement - is a death-trap in an earthquake. But well-made concrete is waterproof, storm proof, fireproof, strong and cheap.\n\nThat is the fundamental contradiction of concrete: incredibly flexible during construction, utterly inflexible afterwards.\n\nIn the hands of an architect or a structural engineer, concrete is a remarkable material. You can pour it into a mould, set it to be slim and stiff and strong in almost any shape you like. It can be dyed, or grey, it can be rough or polished smooth like marble.\n\nBut the moment the building is finished, the flexibility ends: cured concrete is a stubborn, unyielding material.\n\nPerhaps that is why the material has become so associated with arrogant architects and autocratic clients - people who believe that their visions are eternal, rather than likely to need deconstructing and reconstructing as circumstances change.\n\nIn a million years, when our steel has rusted and our wood has rotted, concrete will remain.\n\nBut many of the concrete structures we're building today will be useless within decades. That's because, over a century ago, there was a revolutionary improvement in concrete - but it's an improvement with a fatal flaw.\n\nIn 1867, a French gardener, Joseph Monier, was unhappy with the available range of flower pots, and devised concrete pots, reinforced with a steel mesh.\n\nWell-made reinforced concrete is much stronger and more practical\n\nLess than 20 years later, the elegant idea of pre-stressing the steel was patented. This allowed engineers to use much less of it, and less concrete too.\n\nReinforced concrete is much stronger and more practical than the unreinforced stuff. It can span larger gaps, allowing concrete to soar in the form of bridges and skyscrapers.\n\nBut if cheaply made, it can rot from the inside as water gradually seeps in through tiny cracks, and rusts the steel.\n\nThis process is currently destroying infrastructure across the United States. In 20 or 30 years' time, China will be next.\n\nChina poured more concrete in the three years after 2008 than the United States poured during the entire 20th Century, and nobody thinks that it was all made to exacting standards.\n\nThere are many schemes to make concrete last longer, including special treatments to prevent water getting through to the steel.\n\nThere is \"self-healing\" concrete, full of bacteria that secrete limestone, which re-seals any cracks. And \"self-cleaning\" concrete, infused with titanium dioxide, breaks down smog, keeping the concrete sparkling white.\n\nThe concrete sails of Rome's Dives in Misecordia church include titanium dioxide\n\nImproved versions of the technology may even give us street surfaces that can clean up cars' exhaust fumes.\n\nResearchers are trying to make concrete with less energy use and fewer carbon emissions. The environmental rewards for success will be high.\n\nYet ultimately, there are many more things we could be doing with the simple, trusted technology we already have.\n\nHundreds of millions of people around the world live in dirt-floor houses. Their lives could be improved with a programme like Piso Firme. Other studies have shown large gains from laying concrete roads in rural Bangladesh - improving school attendance, agricultural productivity and boosting farm workers' wages.\n\nPerhaps concrete serves us best when we use it simply.\n\nTim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.
