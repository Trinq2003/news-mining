If you are worrying about anything other than performance then it's a bad sign. You want everything settled in the background, no stresses.\n\n\"After [the 2018 Games] we will have to regroup and reassess where we go from there.\n\n\"I will do everything in my power possible to keep going. I'm hoping to continue for many, many years. It will just be a lot more difficult getting to all of these tournaments around the world.\"\n\nUK Sport made its announcement in December despite Great Britain winning its first Olympic badminton medal since 2004 in Rio.\n\n\"Seeing the boys [Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge] get that men's doubles bronze medal, just thinking about it gives me goosebumps,\" recalls Gilmour, who exited the singles in the group stage as the 11th seed.\n\n\"Everyone was thinking 'yes, we've done it, medal - check. This is amazing'. We showed we could compete on the world stage.\n\n\"I don't think any other sport has overachieved on their set target and then had their funding withdrawn. It's still a shock.\"",

            "section": "Health",
            "content": "The claim: Tuesday 27 December was the busiest day in the history of the National Health Service.\n\nReality Check verdict: In relation to attendance at type-one accident and emergency departments (the general A&E departments at big hospitals), Mr Hunt is correct. That's a reasonable measure of how busy the NHS is, but other measures suggest different days were busier.\n\nSecretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt made the claim on BBC Radio 4's Today programme as he thanked staff for their work over Christmas.\n\nNHS England publishes daily statistics during the winter for several metrics to do with NHS services, so we can look into whether it is the case.\n\nWe can assume he was talking about the NHS in England only, because health is devolved, so he is not in charge of the NHS in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.\n\nThe number of people attending accident and emergency departments is an important indicator of demand for hospital services.\n\nOn 27 December, there were 60,215 attendances at A&E departments.\n\nThat is a high level, but it's not the highest for the month, which was set at 60,692 on 5 December.\n\nBut it turns out that Mr Hunt was talking about only type-one A&E departments, which is what most people would think of as an A&E department.\n\nType-two are specialist units, such as Moorfields Eye Unit, while type-three are GP-led walk-in centres.\n\nThere were 46,315 attendances at type-one A&E departments, which is the highest of the month. Comparisons with previous years are difficult due to changes in coverage and figures not being broken down in the same way.\n\nAnother important measure is the number of emergency admissions, which was 13,715 on 27 December.\n\nThat is a high figure, but the number was higher on each of the following three days - it was 14,649 on 28 December.\n\nLooking at the proportion of beds occupied: on 27 December, 90.5% of the total number of available beds were occupied.\n\nThat's actually quite low by the standards of last month - there were higher figures on 24 days in December.\n\nNHS England says that the week ending 1 January 2017 was the busiest week for the NHS 111 24-hour non-emergency service since it began in August 2010, but we do not get that figure broken down by day so cannot say whether the Tuesday was the busiest day.\n\nWe also do not have daily figures for how busy other parts of the NHS were, such as GPs.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "section": "US & Canada",
            "content": "It is as if the campaign is still going on.\n\nTwo weeks away from his inauguration, Donald Trump seems to prefer the role of \"candidate\" - flaying his opponents and aiming arrows at the federal government from the enemy camp.\n\nIt is almost as if he does not want to accept fully that he is the new chief executive who will be dealing with official Washington from the moment he drives back from the Capitol as the president on 20 January.\n\nAnd his weapon of choice, forged for him like a legendary warrior's sword in the furnace of the new technology, is Twitter.\n\nNo president-elect has battled like this.\n\nMost of them go to ground, secluded with the staff who will take over the West Wing, and make their plans. Dream their dreams, you might say.\n\nThey have followed the golden rule: do not give too much away, because it will make life more difficult when the inauguration is over and the business of power begins.\n\nThe Trump Twitter account is not just a break with that pattern, but a challenge to the very idea.\n\nHis New Year tweet (one of them, I should say) wished love to everyone \"including my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do\".\n\nMr Trump wished love to everyone via Twitter at the turn of the year\n\nThe implication, of course, is that he does know what he is going to do. The trouble with his Twitter account is that it makes you wonder.\n\nMore than 34,000 tweets to nearly 19 million followers (many \"enemies\" among them, no doubt) and a narrative that has become a kind of stream of consciousness. They read like the unfiltered, disconnected thoughts of someone for whom patience is an ugly word.\n\nYou always have to say something, even if you say the opposite the next day. On Twitter, who cares?\n\nYet, the messages are powerful. One contemptuous tweet about the new Republican majority in the House of Representatives winding down the Office of Congressional Ethics led them to beat a humiliating retreat and cancel the plan.\n\nMr Trump's choice as White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said the other day: \"Whatever he tweets, he is going to drive the news.\"\n\nAnd, bizarre though it may seem, the South Korean government is poring over them. The JoongAng Daily reported that a Twitter-watching position had been set up in the foreign ministry in Seoul \"because we don't yet have an insight into his foreign policies\".\n\nWhat insight will they get from tweets which have criticised the Central Intelligence Agency, praised Julian Assange - the Whistleblower of WikiLeaks and a bete noire to most Republicans - and praised President Putin, who gets more friendly treatment than all Democrats and some Republicans at home?\n\nAnd remarkably the tweets take aim at the entire intelligence community in Washington. What precisely are the South Koreans meant to make of that?\n\nNot too much, you may think, because who can tell how this mercurial candidate is going to be moulded into a president? We still do not know and what his Twitter account tells us - colourfully, astonishingly, sometimes hilariously - is that he is refusing to let us know.\n\nFar from revealing what a Trump presidency is going to be like - as he says his tweets do - they have the effect of enveloping him in a thick fog.\n\nYes we know he will \"make America great again\", cut immigration, build his wall, cut taxes, be Israel's greatest ally and so on. But how he is going to build a White House team on foreign affairs and security, conduct relations with Capitol Hill, deal with allies in Nato and the rolling chaos in the Middle East, we have very little idea.\n\nAnd when the first crisis arrives - as it will before long - will he be able to find the calm that he needs?\n\nWhere it all began: Trump's Twitter page in April 2009\n\nNo president-elect in modern times has said so much and revealed so little.\n\nWe know how Mr Trump feels about almost everything, but about priorities, his approach to the compromises of power, the way he will deal with the bureaucracy - in practice we know very little.\n\nA week or two before election day in November, one of his close associates told me that, if he won, Mr Trump had agreed that in office he would relinquish control of that Twitter account, because it would be inappropriate in the White House.\n\nThe satirists' loss, certainly. But, if it happens, a step into reality, at last.\n\nSome day he has to stop being the candidate and playing that game, even though he enjoys it so much.\n\nSo the first great test for the Trump White House team is surely getting his finger off that keyboard.",

            "section": "India",
            "content": "Youth for Parivarthan has more than 1,200 volunteers\n\nThe southern Indian city of Bangalore was long known as the garden city, famed for its lush public parks and gardens, trees and hedges. But four years ago, it was renamed the garbage city, after it began drowning under mounds of rubbish. Some concerned citizens, however, are working to clean up the city, writes the BBC's Geeta Pandey from Bangalore.\n\nOn a Sunday morning, about two dozen young men and women arrive outside the Aishwarya Agate apartment complex in the JP Nagar district, armed with paint, buckets, brushes and rollers.\n\nFor the next few hours, these volunteers from the non-governmental organisation Youth for Parivarthan (Youth for Change) get busy, trying to beautify the wall across the compound.\n\nUgly fading pamphlets are peeled off, the grey wall is hosed clean with a jet of water, a coat of terracotta paint is applied, patterns are drawn with chalk and then painted over with fine brush-strokes.\n\nGeeta Pandey recently spent 10 days working on a series of stories in Bangalore. This is her seventh and final report. You can find the other reports here:\n\nThe volunteers include lawyers, engineers, accountants, students and even an actor.\n\nThis is their 94th project, says Amith Amarnath, the group's founder and president.\n\n\"We did our first project in June 2014. There was a small children's park near my home, filled with garbage. It would stink all the time, everyone was complaining about it,\" he told the BBC. \"So one day, I thought we should stop complaining and start acting.\"\n\nMr Amarnath and a few of his friends went and cleaned up the place. Then they painted the park walls and installed benches to dissuade people from throwing rubbish there again.\n\nThe volunteers begin by scraping off ugly fading pamphlets\n\nBright paint is used to lend cheer to the surroundings\n\nBangalore is often described as the Silicon Valley of India. The city has witnessed rapid growth in the past two decades.\n\nBut along with that prosperity have come problems like traffic snarls and thousands of tonnes of daily garbage.\n\nThe city of 11.5 million people daily generates 8,000 tonnes of rubbish which is collected and transported to landfills outside the city, says Bharath M Palavalli of Fields of View, a non-profit which has been working to create awareness about Bangalore's garbage problems.\n\nBy law, this garbage should be segregated at source between wet food waste and dry recyclable waste like plastics and paper.\n\nYouth for Parivarthan's first project was a small children's park\n\nThe volunteers cleaned up the park, painted its walls and installed benches to dissuade people from throwing rubbish there\n\n\"Ideally what happens in Vegas should remain in Vegas,\" says market researcher and civic evangelist V Ravichandar.\n\n\"Garbage should be sorted and dealt with in the neighbourhood and only 15% should go to landfills.\"\n\nBut civic authorities have long followed the policy of collecting and transporting all the city's garbage to nearby villages instead.\n\nThe flaws of the policy became glaringly obvious in 2012 when garbage collectors went on a strike over a pay dispute with the civic authorities and the city began to drown in rubbish.\n\nDebris is removed from the location\n\nMr Ravichandar describes what happened next as \"a perfect storm\".\n\n\"At the same time, one landfill was closed by the pollution control board for being environmentally hazardous, and another was shut down because local farmers protested.\n\n\"For two weeks, untreated waste was being dumped on the city streets daily. It had been drizzling for days and there were things putrefying,\" says Mr Ravichandar.\n\nBut that became the turning point for the city when it came to garbage management.\n\nMost of the volunteers are students or working professionals\n\nThey work a few hours on each Sunday to beautify their city\n\nWith more awareness, residents in many areas have now begun to segregate their garbage and dry waste collection centres have come up in several neighbourhoods.\n\n\"In areas where people are more aware and the residents' associations are strong, rubbish is getting picked up regularly and things have visibly improved,\" Mr Ravichandar says.\n\nBut many \"black spots\" remain in the city - and that's where groups like Youth for Parivarthan come in.\n\nThe wall across from the Aishwarya Agate apartment that the volunteers are beautifying today used to be a garbage dump until a few days ago.\n\nPatterns are drawn with chalk on the wall and then painted over with fine brush-strokes\n\nResident Purushottam Joshi says he is very happy that these young men and women have done this wonderful work here\n\nFor the past 14 years, resident Purushottam Joshi says every time he stepped out of the gates, he would be greeted by the stench of rotting garbage.\n\n\"We petitioned the local legislator, our MP, the district collector, even the police, but nothing happened. Now I'm very happy that these young men and women have done this wonderful work here,\" he says.\n\nHome-maker Lavanya Shankar says she's \"extremely happy\" to see the \"extremely clean\" wall. \"This is the street where we live, where our children play, and it's wonderful to see this change,\" she says.\n\nMr Amarnath says their reward is the appreciation they receive from the public.\n\nThe volunteers get down to beautifying the drab wall\n\nThey pose for a photograph in front of the finished wall\n\n\"Initially we would spot places to fix, but now people write to us on social media, seeking our help. Earlier, people thought we were just jobless youth, with nothing to do. But ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched his Swachch Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign), public support has been growing for us.\"\n\nAs the volunteers pose for a photograph in front of the finished wall, they say they know that their efforts are like \"a drop in the ocean\". But, as Mr Amarnath says, \"every drop must count\".\n\n\"If we want to see the change, we have to be more involved and aware. If we sit at home and think the government would do everything, then nothing would get done.\"",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Perhaps the defining feature of the global economy is precisely that it is global.\n\nToys from China, copper from Chile, T-shirts from Bangladesh, wine from New Zealand, coffee from Ethiopia, and tomatoes from Spain.\n\nLike it or not, globalisation is a fundamental feature of the modern economy.\n\nIn the early 1960s, world trade in merchandise was less than 20% of world economic output, or gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nNow, it is around 50% but not everyone is happy about it.\n\nThere is probably no other issue where the anxieties of ordinary people are so in conflict with the near-unanimous approval of economists.\n\nArguments over trade tend to frame globalisation as a policy - maybe even an ideology - fuelled by acronymic trade deals like TRIPS and TTIP.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest enabler of globalisation has not been a free trade agreement, but a simple invention: the shipping container.\n\nIt is just a corrugated steel box, 8ft (2.4m) wide, 8ft 6in (2.6m) high, and 40ft (12m) long but its impact has been huge.\n\nBBC World Service's 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy programme highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the global economy.\n\nYou can find more information about its sources and listen online or download the programme podcast.\n\nConsider how a typical trade journey looked before its invention.\n\nIn 1954, an unremarkable cargo ship, the SS Warrior, carried merchandise from New York to Bremerhaven in Germany.\n\nIt held just over 5,000 tonnes of cargo - including food, household goods, letters and vehicles - which were carried as 194,582 separate items in 1,156 different shipments.\n\nJust keeping track of the consignments as they moved around the dockside warehouses was a nightmare.\n\nBut the real challenge was physically loading such ships.\n\nLongshoremen would pile the cargo onto a wooden pallet on the dock.\n\nThe pallet would be hoisted in a sling and deposited in the hold.\n\nMore longshoremen carted each item into a snug corner of the ship, poking the merchandise with steel hooks until it settled into place against the curves and bulkheads of the hold, skilfully packed so that it would not shift on the high seas.\n\nThere were cranes and forklifts but much of the merchandise, from bags of sugar heavier than a man to metal bars the weight of a small car, was shifted with muscle power.\n\nIn a large port, someone would be killed every few weeks.\n\nIn 1950, New York averaged half a dozen serious incidents every day, and its port was safer than many.\n\nResearchers studying the SS Warrior's trip to Bremerhaven concluded the ship had taken ten days to load and unload, as much time as it had spent crossing the Atlantic.\n\nIn today's money, the cargo cost around $420 (\u00a3335) a tonne to move.\n\nGiven typical delays in sorting and distributing the cargo by land, the whole journey might take three months.\n\nSixty years ago, then, shipping goods internationally was costly, chancy, and immensely time-consuming.\n\nSurely there had to be a better way?\n\nIndeed there was: put all the cargo into big standard boxes, and move those.\n\nBut inventing the box was the easy bit - the shipping container had already been tried in various forms for decades.\n\nThe real challenge was overcoming the social obstacles.\n\nTo begin with, the trucking companies, shipping companies, and ports could not agree on a standard size.\n\nSome wanted large containers while others wanted smaller versions; perhaps because they specialised in heavy goods or trucked on narrow mountain roads.\n\nThen there were the powerful dockworkers' unions, who resisted the idea.\n\nYes the containers would make the job of loading ships safer but it would also mean fewer jobs.\n\nMalcom McLean understood how revolutionary containerisation could be for shipping\n\nUS regulators also preferred the status quo.\n\nThe sector was tightly bound with red tape, with separate sets of regulations determining how much that shipping and trucking companies could charge.\n\nWhy not simply let companies charge whatever the market would bear - or even allow shipping and trucking companies to merge, and put together an integrated service?\n\nPerhaps the bureaucrats too were simply keen to preserve their jobs.\n\nSuch bold ideas would have left them with less to do.\n\nThe man who navigated this maze of hazards, and who can fairly be described as the inventor of the modern shipping container system, was called Malcom McLean.\n\nMcLean did not know anything about shipping but he was a trucking entrepreneur.\n\nHe knew plenty about trucks, plenty about playing the system, and all there was to know about saving money.\n\nAs Marc Levinson explains in his book, The Box, McLean not only saw the potential of a shipping container that would fit neatly onto a flat bed truck, he also had the skills and the risk-taking attitude needed to make it happen.\n\nFirst, McLean cheekily exploited a legal loophole to gain control of both a shipping company and a trucking company.\n\nThen, when dockers went on strike, he used the idle time to refit old ships to new container specifications.\n\nHe took on \"fat cat\" incumbents in Puerto Rico, revitalising the island's economy by slashing shipping rates to the United States.\n\nHe cannily encouraged New York's Port Authority to make the New Jersey side of the harbour a centre for container shipping.\n\nBut probably the most striking coup took place in the late 1960s, when Malcom McLean sold the idea of container shipping to perhaps the world's most powerful customer: the US Military.\n\nFaced with an unholy logistical nightmare in trying to ship equipment to Vietnam, the military turned to McLean's container ships.\n\nContainers work much better when they are part of an integrated logistical system, and the US military was perfectly placed to implement that.\n\nEven better, McLean realised that on the way back from Vietnam, his empty container ships could collect payloads from the world's fastest growing economy, Japan.\n\nAnd so trans-Pacific trading began in earnest.\n\nA modern shipping port would be unrecognisable to a hardworking longshoreman of the 1950s.\n\nEven a modest container ship might carry 20 times as much cargo as the SS Warrior did, yet disgorge its cargo in hours rather than days.\n\nGigantic cranes weighing 1,000 tonnes apiece lock onto containers which themselves weigh upwards of 30 tonnes, and swing them up and over on to a waiting transporter.\n\nThe colossal ballet of engineering is choreographed by computers, which track every container as it moves through a global logistical system.\n\nThe refrigerated containers are put in a hull section with power and temperature monitors.\n\nThe heavier containers are placed at the bottom to keep the ship's centre of gravity low.\n\nThe entire process is scheduled to keep the ship balanced.\n\nAnd after the crane has released one container onto a waiting transporter, it will grasp another before swinging back over the ship, which is being simultaneously emptied and refilled.\n\nNot everywhere enjoys the benefits of the containerisation revolution.\n\nMany ports in poorer countries still look like New York in the 1950s.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa, in particular, remains largely cut off from the world economy because of poor infrastructure.\n\nBut for an ever-growing number of destinations, goods can now be shipped reliably, swiftly and cheaply.\n\nRather than the $420 (\u00a3335) that a customer would have paid to get the SS Warrior to ship a tonne of goods across the Atlantic in 1954, you might now pay less than $50 (\u00a339).\n\nIndeed, economists who study international trade often assume that transport costs are zero.\n\nIt keeps the mathematics simpler, they say, and thanks to the shipping container, it is nearly true.\n\nTim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.

            "section": "Health",
            "content": "The Sun newspaper on Monday carries the headline \"Kill by mouth: Two die in NHS each day of thirst or starvation\".\n\nA shocking claim, based on figures from the Office of National Statistics.\n\nThe data for England and Wales shows that in 2015, hunger and/or dehydration were a factor in 828 patient deaths in hospitals and care homes.\n\nBut that doesn't mean all of these patients starved to death or died of thirst, experts at the ONS were quick to point out when I spoke with them about it.\n\nMalnutrition may be recorded on the death certificate as a factor contributing directly to a death when it was a complication of a different underlying cause, such as cancer of the stomach, for example.\n\nIf you are very sick, it might not be feasible or desirable to eat and drink. Having a disease such as advanced cancer can cause malnutrition.\n\nThat's not to say that patients who are terminally ill should have fluid and nutrients withheld. On the contrary, guidelines make it clear that even if a patient can't eat or drink they should still be provided for.\n\nThey were drawn up after reports revealed some patients at the end of life were being denied this basic right when they were put on a care protocol called the Liverpool Care Pathway.\n\nThe LCP was scrapped in 2015 after relatives complained that their loved ones had been put on it without their knowledge and denied fluids, which hastened their deaths.\n\nAnother dark period in history for the NHS was the Stafford Hospital Scandal, where hundreds of patients died amid appalling levels of care between 2005 and 2009.\n\nAn inquiry identified terrible and unnecessary suffering, including examples where patients had been provided with food and drink, but it had been left out of their reach.\n\nJoan Morris suffered a heart attack and died four weeks after being admitted to Stafford General Hospital\n\nJoan Morris, 83, was admitted to Stafford Hospital in December 2006 with a chest infection.\n\nHer family said that food and water had been left on a table instead of being given to her.\n\nAnother patient, Tom Wilhelms, resorted to drinking from a vase.\n\nIn response to the Francis Inquiry into the failings at the Mid Staffordshire Foundation Trust, the government published new hospital standards including around nutritional and hydration care.\n\nAnd it asked the Care Quality Commission to make sure that the hospitals and care homes it inspected were following these standards.\n\nThe CQC's first dedicated review was in 2012.\n\nIt inspected 500 care homes and 50 hospitals in England and found 83% of care homes and 88% of hospitals it inspected met people's nutritional needs, which means patients were provided a suitable choice of food and drink and given help to eat and drink when they needed it.\n\nIt says this shows things have improved.\n\nProf Sir Mike Richards, CQC Chief Inspector of Hospitals, said: \"We expect the food provided to be nutritious, to meet people's dietary requirements, and for this to be included as part of patients care planning while in hospital, and we look closely at this on our inspections. Where we find this is not happening or identify concerns that people's nutritional needs are not being met we take action and have a range of enforcement powers at our disposal where required.\"\n\nAge UK agrees that there's been progress, but says malnutrition in the NHS is still a big issue.\n\nLesley Carter, who works of the charity and is programme manager of the Malnutrition Task Force, says a third of people going into hospitals and care homes are already malnourished or at risk of malnutrition when they are admitted.\n\n\"That means they are already vulnerable to start with.\"\n\nShe said that on busy wards, mealtimes might get rushed or overlooked without the right staffing.\n\n\"Older people in particular might need help to eat and drink, and they aren't always getting this. Food can still be left out of reach.\n\n\"Some hospitals have employed nutrition nurses to spot those patients that need help, and nutrition assistants to help with the feeding, which is good.\n\n\"But it is time consuming to feed someone properly.\"\n\nShe says friends and families have a responsibility to keep a check on elderly loved ones too.\n\n\"We all need to realise that it's not natural to lose weight as we age.\"\n\nAlthough elderly people should be encouraged to eat a healthy diet, she says this can backfire.\n\nA salad might be worse than cake in terms of nutrition for someone who is old and frail and has a poor appetite, for example.\n\n\"Some residents in care homes are being given low fat yoghurt and semi-skimmed milk when instead they should get full fat milk.\"",

I'm up for it, if our audience is as excited as we are\u2026 it's gonna be a great night.\"\n\n\"It seems like we have come full circle from when The Joshua Tree songs were originally written, with global upheaval, extreme right wing politics and some fundamental human rights at risk,\" added guitarist The Edge.\n\n\"To celebrate the album - as the songs seem so relevant and prescient of these times too - we decided to do these shows, it feels right for now. We're looking forward to it.\"\n\nSupport acts confirmed for the tour include OneRepublic, The Lumineers and, in the UK and Europe, Noel Gallagher.\n\n\"It will be both a pleasure and an honour to play my part in what still remains the greatest show on earth,\" said Gallagher.\n\nU2 also plan to release a new album, Songs of Experience, later this year.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

            "section": "Technology",
            "content": "Can CES delight the ear as well as the eye?\n\nCES is a visual feast of lights, colour, people, costumes - and of course endless gadgets.\n\nThere are plenty of striking pictures from the show floor.\n\nBut are any of the exhibitors interested in delighting your ears?\n\nRather like the city of Las Vegas itself, it has its own distinctive beat.\n\nThere's the hubbub of chatter. The hiss of vending cart coffee machines. The thumping bass and discord of various sound systems vying for attention. The amplified echo of a hundred demonstrations. The ringtones and message alerts from thousands of mobile phones.\n\nAnd also - this being a tech fair - the whizzes and ticks and buzzes and bings of robots and drones.\n\nRobots make quite a racket - just what you'd expect at a football match\n\nAfter hours of stalking the vast halls of CES besieged by visuals, I decided to try and find beguiling sounds instead.\n\nThings did not get off to a good start.\n\nThe first robot I encountered - a service machine designed to guide people around museums - responded to my greeting by asking me whether I was \"fickle after kissing\".\n\nIts mortified owner told me it was confused. It wasn't the only one.\n\nNext, I asked one of the show guides where I could find some interesting noises, and was promptly escorted to a section of the show floor dedicated to in-car speakers.\n\nI had to explain that as much as I admire Lady Gaga, the strains of her hit Bad Romance blasting out of the back of a Jeep rammed floor-to-ceiling with sub woofers wasn't what I had in mind either.\n\nIt was in a start-up zone called Eureka Park that I struck audio gold.\n\nSome gadgets, like the cuddly Talkies, can't wait to speak up\n\nI was drawn in by the sound of crickets - very incongruous in a giant exhibition hall with no natural light, let alone greenery. It was coming from an air purifier called Clair with a built-in Bluetooth speaker nestling at a tiny stand towards the back.\n\n\"When people sleep they need fresh air and also this kind of sound can help people sleep better,\" said a spokesman who introduced himself as Bono from South Korea.\n\n\"So, we put them both together.\"\n\nIt's the sort of stuff that's perfect for radio, in fact. After that, I captured the warm American male tones of a virtual assistant designed for cars and the staccato gunfire of a man who was evidently immersed in a VR game of mortal combat that only he could see.\n\nNext came machine-like marching sounds from a team of forearm-sized Aelos robots playing miniature football, and a delegate attempting to play Let It Be by The Beatles on a Magic Instruments digital guitar. It's supposed to be easy to learn. Perhaps he tried the wrong tune.\n\nThe Emys robot has a natural sounding voice - and looks like a cross between ET and a Ninja Turtle\n\nI bonded with natural-voiced Emys, a Kickstarter-funded desktop robot that looked like a cross between ET and a Ninja Turtle. It has been designed to teach young children foreign languages (did you know that castle in Spanish is castillo?).\n\nI also hugged a gurgling Talkie - a cuddly little monster with wi-fi that you can use to exchange voice messages with your children.\n\nOlly, a robot that claims to adapt to the personality of its owner, told me about feeling both happy and sad in a mournfully child-like voice.\n\n\"By the end of the day I'll be dead,\" complained an uncomfortable promotions girl, fidgeting in a pair of towering stilettos.\n\n\"And if I'm not - just kill me.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a little bat-shaped speaker chimed like a casino slot machine, as it tried to re-establish a connection with the smartphone it was supposed to be streaming music from.\n\nWhat's the sound of CES? It's all of those things. All at the same time. All day long. And it's music to my ears.\n\nListen to Zoe's radio report on The World This Weekend, on Radio 4 at 13:00 GMT",

The fish is found in the Duck and Buffalo Rivers of the Tennessee River drainage.\n\nThe Obamadon, an extinct, foot-long lizard with straight teeth, was named for the president due to his smile.\n\nMr Obama is among the US presidents to have the distinction of a mountain named in his honour - but in Antigua. The island nation renamed Boggy Peak, its highest mountain, for Mr Obama on his birthday in 2009.\n\nResearchers named Caloplaca obamae in honour of Mr Obama's support for science education\n\nIn 2007, researchers named the fungus, Caloplaca obamae, after Mr Obama at the close of his first presidential campaign. Scientists made the distinction in honour of Mr Obama's support for science education.\n\nThe County Offaly village of Moneygall was the birthplace of Barack Obama's great-great-great-grandfather\n\nAn Irish countryside service station located in County Offaly, between Dublin and Limerick, was officially named for the US president.\n\nThe Barack Obama Plaza includes a petrol station, food court and visitor centre that provides information on Mr Obama's connections to Moneygall.\n\nIn 2011 Irish bakers made Brack bread in the president's honour\n\nAhead of Mr Obama's visit to Ireland in 2011, bakers rushed to create Irish \"Brack\" bread - something Americans might refer to as a fruit loaf.\n\nNo word on if Mr Obama sampled one of the Irish treats\n\nA Western Striolated puffbird, known as Nystalus obamai, is also named in honour of the president. The bird is found in western Amazonia.\n\nA Kenyan school in the village of Kogelo, where Mr Obama's father was born and buried, bears the name of Mr Obama.\n\nThe Senator Obama Kogelo Primary School and Senator Obama Kogelo Secondary School were named in his honour while he was an Illinois politician.\n\nAptostichus barackobamai is one of 33 trapdoor spider species discovered in 2013\n\nA trapdoor spider, Aptostichus barackobamai, was also named for Mr Obama, a known Spider-Man fan.\n\nThe spider species, which is found in California, is one of 40 that belong to the genus Aptostichus.",

            "section": "Magazine",
            "content": "Drone pilot Lt Col Matt Martin says his role is \"surreal\"\n\nIn the past, soldiers went off to war and left their families behind. But drone pilots commute to work - and to war - each day. Vin Ray was given rare access to the only US Air Force base devoted entirely to flying drones, where he discovered the pilots' strange double life.\n\nIf you're a drone pilot, there's a strong possibility you live in Las Vegas. And your commute to work is against the traffic.\n\nWe were told to drive northwest out of the city on US Route 95. The road stretches out through the barren, inhospitable scrub of the Nevada desert.\n\nPay attention, we were told, because the signpost is small. In fact, it's very small. But we eventually arrived at our destination: Creech US Air Force Base, a small, flat, city in the desert. And the only air base devoted to flying drones.\n\nInside the base, comparisons with science fiction are hard to avoid. A drone looks like a conflation of a giant insect and a light aircraft. It's unmanned.\n\nStanding by a runway, we watch a drone land and pass right in front of us.\n\nThe camera underneath its chin, swivels quickly sideways and looks right at us - someone, somewhere on the base, is watching us.\n\nI'm escorted through a non-descript door in the side of what looks like a beige metal shipping container. It's cramped inside. At the far end there's a pilot seated on the left, who flies the drone and fires the missiles.\n\nThe sensor operator sits on the right - they operate the camera and fix the laser on the target for the missile to hit. They're focused on a bank of screens, switches and buttons. This is today's kind of cockpit. But it doesn't feel like a battleground.\n\nFor a start, there's a sensory deficiency. From my experience on the ground, you can taste war - you can smell it and you can certainly hear it. In here there's a just a mute video.\n\nBut that's not the only difference.\n\nTraditionally, soldiers in a war zone are based together. They have each others' camaraderie, and they're separated from their families.\n\nBut it's not the same if you're commuting to work every day.\n\nObviously, the drive itself is simple. But the psychological journey is altogether different. Imagine. Between six in the evening and six in the morning you might collect your kids from school, pick up some groceries on the way home and help make dinner.\n\nBut between 6am and 6pm you have a licence to kill.\n\nThis commute is familiar to Lt Col Matt Martin. He's a hugely experienced former drone pilot. He exudes a quiet strength and a ready charm.\n\nBut he talks about his schizophrenic existence, his inability to have a normal life and the strain it took on his family.\n\n\"It's a surreal enterprise,\" he says. \"You only have the drive to work and then you're flying. So for me, I would take that drive to switch gears. I would step into my cockpit and be totally immersed in flying the drone. Then a few hours later I would step out and be back in Las Vegas, in a totally different time zone, different time of day.\"\n\nHere's what the base commander Col Case Cunningham told me: \"When they walk through the gate, they're in a war. Although physically they are at home, mentally they're at war. So in effect we're asking them to redeploy every single day, to go back home and be parents and be loved ones - and then come back to war again\".\n\nSuch are the new frontiers of the modern battlefield.\n\nThese drone pilots can sit in Nevada and watch a potential target 8,000 miles (12,000km) away for months on end, building up what they call \"patterns of life\" - building what's been called a \"remote intimacy\" with their prey - all in the knowledge that, one day, they may kill them.\n\nA conventional fighter pilot will fire missiles and then head back to base. But drone pilots are required to circle for some hours afterwards, to assess the damage. The picture they're looking at is extraordinarily clear - and the damage is often in the form of body parts.\n\nSmall wonder that Creech now employs a psychologist for drone pilots suffering stress. Drones are globalising the battlefield, blurring the boundaries between war and home.\n\nAs we get ready to leave the base, the moon rises over the mountains and darkness falls quickly. There's a long traffic jam as some of the 3,500 air staff wait at the gates to leave the base - a snake of red tail lights heading back to Vegas and the warmth of their families.\n\nAnd when they get home? Well, friction can stem from one simple question: \"How was your day?\"\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.",

The 19-year-old decided to do something about it and applied for a TV dating show.\n\nYou always hear girls say 'ooh what's your type? Oh tall, you know tall and handsome' and I'm the total opposite of that.\n\nAt 4ft 7in people have always asked me 'would you have wanted to be born taller?' But now, I can't imagine life any other way.\n\nWhen I was younger I never saw myself as having a disability. I wasn't even aware of it until my teenage years when growth spurts happened to others and I started to see that I was different and school became very difficult.\n\nMy fellow students at school in Leicester would ask 'Pani why are you so small? Were you born the size of a pea?' Thinking back, all those things that hurt me could have easily been avoided by realising people were just curious - they were kids asking silly questions.\n\nI have what's known as Achondroplasia - a form of dwarfism. Apparently I'm taller than average for my condition but still quite tiny and it definitely affected potential relationships and how I have viewed myself over the years.\n\nMy male friends and I would always talk about girls and celebrities, the ones we would dream of marrying and how we would ask them out. But this is when things went very wrong for me.\n\nAt the age of 12 I asked a girl out. We went to the cinema and seemed to have a good time, but the next day the gossip began.\n\nI secretly told a friend in the school library that I liked her but he wrote it in big letters on the whiteboard for everyone to see - when I saw it I wanted to disappear from the face of the earth.\n\nMyself and the girl both ended up in tears and she felt too embarrassed to talk to me again.\n\nThat was when I lost all of my confidence and thought I was not good enough because of my height.\n\nI stopped talking to girls and I certainly wouldn't reveal if I fancied someone.\n\nI was afraid of what girls would think of me, always worrying they might ignore or tease me, or treat me like a nobody, because I was different.\n\nIt was a very difficult time of my life.\n\nWhen I reached college, however, things started to look up. Everyone seemed to have matured and the general bullying stopped. It became a time for me to discover who I was, and what I wanted to do with my future.\n\nSadly, this new way of thinking didn't mean my love life improved and I had other challenges to overcome including going to nightclubs with friends.\n\nI wouldn't have the confidence to go up to girls, chat to them or ask them to dance. I always felt that because I was different if a woman approached me it was so she could tick it off her bucket list.\n\nIt was at this point, having never had a girlfriend, I decided to contact Channel 4's The Undateables - a reality show which tries to match disabled people with a partner - and so face my fear of dating with the hope of potentially finding somebody.\n\nIt was a drastic thing to do but I thought if I could successfully go on a date on a television show I wouldn't have any confidence problems in the future.\n\nFacing my fears worked and I now feel able to approach a woman and have a conversation with her because I have learned there isn't anything to be afraid of. If the girl doesn't like me fair enough, but some open-minded people will like me.\n\nI had been competing internationally in shot put and javelin and hoped to compete in the Paralympic Games in Rio last year but injury forced me to take time out.\n\nParticipating in The Undateables helped me to focus on a different aspect of life and took my mind off the injury although I've now returned to training with my sights set on the 2020 Paralympics in Tokyo as well as taking a degree in law.\n\nThis process has further boosted my confidence and I've realised that being short isn't a barrier it's a feature. All this time I shouldn't have thought of myself as less of a person.\n\nBeing me is the best thing I can do better than anyone else.\n\nThe Undateables transmits on Monday nights at 21:00 GMT on Channel 4 and is also available on All 4.\n\nFor more Disability News, follow on Twitter and Facebook, and subscribe to the weekly podcast.",

Nokia also briefly sold Android-based handsets - known as Nokia X - in 2014.\n\nMicrosoft used Nokia's brand for a short time after buying the company's mobile devices the same year, but later referred to the devices solely by their Lumia name.\n\nNokia once dominated the mobile phone market but struggled after the launch of the iPhone a decade ago, and the subsequent release of Google's Android operating system.\n\nHMD Global had previously indicated it would release several Nokia-branded Android phones in 2017.\n\nIt is expected to provide details of at least some of the other launches at another trade show - Barcelona's Mobile World Congress - in February.\n\n\"The decision by HMD to launch its first Android smartphone into China is a reflection of the desire to meet the real world needs of consumers in different markets around the world,\" the firm said in a statement.\n\n\"With over 552 million smartphone users in China in 2016, a figure that is predicted to grow to more than 593 million users by 2017, it is a strategically important market where premium design and quality is highly valued by consumers.\"\n\nHMD Gobal sells feature phones, including the Nokia 150, in other parts of the world\n\nThe Nokia 6 phone runs Android 7.0 - the latest version, also known as Nougat - and features:\n\nThe specifications are mid-range, and so is the price: 1,699 yuan ($245; \u00a3200).\n\nThat makes it slightly more expensive than Huawei's Honor 6X but cheaper than Xiaomi's Mi 5s.\n\n\"Nokia remains one of the most recognised mobile phone brands on the planet,\" commented Ben Wood from the CCS Insight technology consultancy.\n\n\"HMD Global will be hoping it can capitalise on this as it seeks to relaunch Nokia devices in 2017.\n\n\"It will be hoping the brand will help it stand out in the incredibly crowded Android smartphone market, which is characterised by cut-throat competition and a sea of design sameness. \"\n\nBrandon Ackroyd, Head of Customer Insight at Tiger Mobiles believes that Nokia will launch the Nokia 6 globally if the device has a successful launch in Asia.\n\n\"If the Nokia 6 performs well in China then it's highly likely we will see a new international variant of the handset sometime in 2017. We'll be keeping our eyes on the certification websites in the coming months looking for a variant with more connectivity options like GSM, LTE, and CDMA that will make the device compatible with networks worldwide.\"\n\nFollow all our CES coverage at bbc.co.uk/ces2017\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "section": "Technology",
            "content": "Not the greatest shot - but a landmark moment\n\nTen years ago I was running from San Francisco\u2019s Moscone Centre to a nearby hotel to edit a piece for the Ten O\u2019Clock News when my phone rang.\n\nThose were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change.\n\n\u201cHave you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?\u201d shouted a producer in London. \u201cIf not, why not?\u201d\n\nThis appeared to be an impossible demand.\n\nSteve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle.\n\nThen I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple\u2019s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone.\n\nHe graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O\u2019Clock News piece.\n\nThe following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were \u201ca fragment of the true cross\u201d, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch.\n\nI appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we\u2019d had a TV news bulletin back then.\n\nAfterwards, I rather regretted saying that - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership?\n\nBut today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade, putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries.\n\nWe have become accustomed to having a quality camera a hand's reach away\n\nOne example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It\u2019s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage.\n\nCompare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer.\n\nThis 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days.\n\nMy point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move.\n\nOf course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text.\n\nSo, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.\n\nOther firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.",
