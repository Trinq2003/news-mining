            "description": "Celebrated justice campaigner Don Hale reveals the pressures he has faced in his years as a righter of legal wrongs.",
            "section": "Derby",
            "content": "Don Hale has helped to clear Barry George, Stephen Downing and Ched Evans\n\nFifteen years ago Stephen Downing was acquitted after spending 27 years in prison for murder, overturning one of Britain's most notorious miscarriages of justice and putting into the spotlight the local newspaper editor who helped to bring the police's case tumbling down.\n\nDon Hale could hardly have foreseen that by championing the case he would go on to suffer police intimidation and receive death threats - there were even two apparent attempts on his life - forcing him to leave his Derbyshire home.\n\nBut the Downing case would eventually change the law, win Hale an OBE and make him a go-to journalist to investigate major miscarriages of justice.\n\nIn the years since the release of Mr Downing, Hale has also helped to free Barry George, the man who spent eight years in jail for the murder of Jill Dando, and to clear the name of footballer, Ched Evans, after a controversial rape retrial.\n\nDon Hale was editor of weekly local newspaper, the Matlock Mercury, during his battle to free Stephen Downing\n\nFor Hale, the brutal trigger for his life of campaigning was the 1973 killing of 32-year-old Wendy Sewell.\n\nShe was found badly beaten but still alive in a Bakewell graveyard by Mr Downing, a council gardener.\n\nHe was arrested and questioned without a solicitor for several hours but, aged 17 and with a reading age of 11, officers pressured him into signing a confession to the attack, filled with words he did not understand.\n\nWhen Mrs Sewell died two days later, the charge was upgraded to murder. Mr Downing immediately retracted his confession but was found guilty at a trial at Nottingham Crown Court.\n\nLegal secretary Wendy Sewell, dubbed \"the Bakewell Tart\" in the press, was left for dead in the cemetery\n\nAfter their son had spent two decades in prison, Mr Downing's parents approached Hale, editor of the Matlock Mercury, for help.\n\nHe faced obstacles at every turn, with police telling him all the evidence had been \"burnt, lost and destroyed\".\n\nA turning point came when Derby Museum staff informed him that the murder weapon - a pickaxe handle - was on display there.\n\nWith Hale's help, Mr Downing won \u00a313,000 from the Legal Aid Board.\n\nThis paid for a modern forensic examination of the weapon, crucially revealing Mr Downing's fingerprints were not present - although there was a bloody palm print from an unknown person.\n\nThe clothes Mr Downing had been wearing, which had been returned to his parents, were flecked with spots of blood which Hale believed were consistent with him having tried to help Wendy Sewell as she lay dying.\n\nTwenty years after the murder Hale reshot scene of crime photographs in Bakewell cemetery\n\n\"I reported developments through the Matlock Mercury - it became like The Archers, a bit of a saga,\" he joked.\n\nBut the articles prompted real-life drama in the form of anonymous death threats and what Hale claims was police harassment.\n\n\"They made my life absolute hell for five or six years,\" he said.\n\n\"I was pulled up for speeding, stopped and searched, victimised.\"\n\nLetters were sent to his home and a brick was thrown through the newspaper's window.\n\nMost seriously, on two occasions a vehicle was driven at him at speed, which he believes were attempts to kill him.\n\nPolice even gave him a mirror on a stick to check for bombs under his car.\n\n\"I was very worried for my family. There weren't threats against other journalists, it was simply against me. It turned into a rollercoaster,\" he said.\n\nBut all of this merely strengthened his resolve: \"If Downing had done it, why should anyone want to threaten me?\"\n\nMr Downing was ineligible for parole under the law at the time because he had refused to admit his guilt.\n\nHale believed this was unfair and took the matter to the European Court of Human Rights, winning the case in 1996.\n\nIt was adopted into law that prisoners who maintained their innocence after conviction could apply for parole.\n\nDerbyshire Dales MP Patrick McLoughlin became one of the Downing campaign's high-profile supporters\n\nBy now, the Downing case was attracting attention from far and wide: \"I became a hero in Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Argentina, because I had taken on the British government and won,\" Hale said.\n\nCloser to home, Hale said then Prime Minister Tony Blair asked him for help in setting up an independent body to investigate miscarriages of justice, which became the Criminal Case Review Commission (CCRC).\n\nStephen Downing's was one of the first cases to be looked at by the CCRC.\n\nIt recommended his conviction should be overturned on the basis that the circumstances in which he gave his confession made it unreliable evidence that should not have gone before a jury.\n\nThe conviction was quashed in 2001 with Mr Downing finally walking free in January 2002.\n\nHale and Stephen Downing on the steps of the Royal Courts of Justice in January, 2002, after his conviction was overturned\n\nHale was pleased but also disappointed: \"He had got off on a technicality,\" he said.\n\n\"He didn't get his day in court because police were bang to rights. Somebody should have been called to account.\"\n\nThe legal challenge to Mr Downing's conviction focused on the way detectives had conducted the original investigation in 1973.\n\nHe had been questioned without a lawyer and there were serious doubts about whether he had been properly advised of his legal rights.\n\nThese facts were never made known to the jury that convicted him, but they were enough to overturn the conviction.\n\nBut Mr Downing, for his part, was not angry: \"Who would I feel bitter against? The system? I think I would be punishing myself,\" he said.\n\nWith much more to say himself, Hale wrote the book, Town Without Pity, which was turned into BBC drama, In Denial of Murder, in 2004.\n\nIn Denial of Murder starred Stephen Tompkinson as Don Hale and Jason Watkins as Stephen Downing\n\nPolice reopened their investigation, interviewing 1,600 witnesses, at an estimated cost of \u00a3500,000, but failed to identify any alternative suspect - although Hale has previously said he believes he has a \"very good idea\" who killed Wendy Sewell.\n\nMr Downing was later awarded \u00a3900,000 in compensation.\n\nThe huge press attention the case attracted finally forced Hale to relocate to north Wales.\n\n\"One of the reasons I moved away from Derbyshire was to get relief,\" he said. \"It wasn't fair on my family.\"\n\nJill Dando's killer has never been brought to justice\n\nBut he was soon called on to help with another miscarriage of justice.\n\nBBC Crimewatch presenter Jill Dando was shot dead on her fianc\u00e9's west London doorstep in April 1999.\n\nA year later, after interviewing over hundreds of people, the Met Police charged 41-year-old Barry George, a self-confessed stalker and loner, with her murder. He was tried, convicted and jailed for life.\n\nBut there were serious concerns about the police investigation, and in 2004 Hale was asked to get involved.\n\n\"Quite quickly, I found a lot of evidence that didn't match up,\" he said.\n\nBarry George was \"an oddball but not a killer\", Hale said\n\nHe went to see Mr George in prison where he was \"like a lion in a cage\", pacing the floor.\n\n\"How could he do a clinical murder like that?\" Hale said.\n\n\"Everyone that was dealing with him said he's a bit of an oddball but he's not a killer.\"\n\nGunpowder residue on Mr George's clothing had played a large part in convicting him.\n\nBut Hale said there was so little of it that it could have come from weapons armed police were carrying when he was arrested.\n\nThe CCRC referred Mr George's case to the Court of Appeal and a retrial took place at the Old Bailey in 2008, when he was cleared of murder and released.\n\nChed Evans was serving a five-year sentence for rape when his family approached Hale for help.\n\n\"I didn't want to touch it because it was so high profile,\" he said.\n\nBut Mr Evans' mother had serious doubts about the \"rushed\" investigation.\n\nThe then-Sheffield United striker had been convicted of raping a 19-year-old woman at a Premier Inn in Denbighshire in May 2011.\n\nAt the same trial, footballer Clayton McDonald was acquitted of the offence.\n\nHale believed the guilty verdict was an \"emotional response\" from the jury, owing to Mr Evans' \"cockiness\". \"He thought he was God's gift to women,\" Hale said.\n\nHe spent six months working on the case, in which time Mr Evans was released having served half of his sentence.\n\n\"My knowledge and experience meant I could cut corners and had an important point that I knew the IPCC would look at.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. A timeline of events leading to Ched Evans clearing his name\n\nThat point was the woman's sexual history and, after the CCRC agreed there was enough evidence to quash the conviction, this evidence controversially formed part of the retrial.\n\nUnlike during the original trial, her previous sexual partners gave evidence recounting similar encounters to the one in the hotel room that night.\n\nIt led to plans to review the law protecting alleged rape victims from disclosing details of their sex lives.\n\nMr Evans was cleared in October 2016 but it left a bitter taste for Hale.\n\n\"In this case it was right - you have got to look at each case on its own merit,\" he said.\n\n\"But the whole thing was a bit unsavoury and not good for the girl herself.\"\n\nHale said at the time he hoped the case did not deter women from coming forward to report sexual offences.\n\nBut, had that evidence been used in the original trial, \"Evans would have been cleared,\" he said.\n\nThe case took its toll on Hales, now 64, and he has decided not to investigate any more miscarriages of justice, focusing instead on writing books.\n\n\"I am proud of what I have done,\" he said.\n\n\"If it wasn't for people like me you'd have no-one to say, 'this isn't the way we should interview people, this is not the way we should treat people'.\"\n\nYet he still insists modestly that much of the credit for overturning the miscarriages of justice he has worked on belongs to others, seeing himself more as a catalyst for change.\n\n\"You have got to have somebody who gets the ball rolling.\"",

            "description": "Prime Minister Theresa May's visit to the US to meet President Donald Trump features on most of the front pages.",
            "section": "The Papers",
            "content": "Many of the papers lead on Theresa May's visit to meet Donald Trump\n\nThere is widespread coverage of Prime Minister Theresa May's trip to the US on the front pages of many of the newspapers.\n\nThe i predicts it will be a \"tricky visit\" amid transatlantic tension about Mr Trump's comments on using torture.\n\nThe Guardian thinks Mrs May will shrug off concerns about Mr Trump's presidency - and pledge to rekindle the special relationship between the two countries.\n\nThe Daily Express says she will begin her two-day visit with an optimistic and heartfelt call for the renewal of the relationship.\n\nThe papers also report on Mrs May's decision to publish a White Paper policy document on the government's plans to leave the EU.\n\nFor the Daily Mirror the decision is a U-turn, but the Daily Telegraph sees it as a sensible and straightforward move.\n\nThe paper challenges the prime minister's opponents on the issue to explain their European policy to voters.\n\nThe Sun sees the political logic of the White Paper, but worries that her Labour opponents and Tory rebels will not hesitate to push for more.\n\nThe i acknowledges that Mrs May's pledge to publish the document was an olive branch to pro-EU Tories, but it thinks it will probably amount to her 12-point plan being cut and pasted into an official-looking paper.\n\nThe Guardian feels the document will be a fairly minimalist statement of the government's Brexit aims.\n\nIt urges Mrs May to say in the White Paper how she wants to consult and take the devolved governments into account.\n\nThe Financial Times believes Labour Party divisions over Europe are likely to dominate debate in the coming weeks, with a sizeable minority of pro-EU Labour MPs expected to vote against triggering Article 50.\n\nThe political sketch writers seize on Jeremy Corbyn's performance after Mrs May made her announcement about the White Paper at Prime Minister's Questions.\n\nPatrick Kidd in the Times describes how he was caught off balance by her decision - and when he needed to think on his feet he was as twinkle-toed as a rhinoceros.\n\nQuentin Letts in the Daily Mail is scathing, saying he made a right Horlicks of it.\n\nMr Corbyn, says the Guardian's John Crace, achieved the near impossible by making the prime minister look more like a decisive world leader than a badly-programmed robot.\n\nThe financial pages consider the reasons for the Dow Jones Index in the US breaking through the 20,000 barrier for the first time.\n\nThe Guardian feels investors have shown their approval for Mr Trump's growth agenda.\n\nThe Daily Mail suggests the rally has been ignited by some of his executive orders restoring the primacy of home-grown energy industries over environmental concerns.\n\nMany of the papers lead on Theresa May's visit to meet Donald Trump\n\nHowever, the i suspects it has more to do with the forthcoming fiscal boost than the impact of Mr Trump's trade policies.\n\nThe Financial Times attempts to put the rise into context, pointing out that just five of the 30 companies in the index account for half of the Dow's rise since election day.\n\nThe Times, Daily Telegraph and the Mail all report that the Department for Transport is considering taking direct control of Southern rail, whose services have been disrupted by delays and months of strikes.\n\nThe Mail thinks an internal investigation will decide whether Southern's performance is so poor that it has breached the terms of its contract.\n\nThe Times says the company could be sacked within weeks.\n\nThe Telegraph believes such a decision would be politically sensitive because it would be claimed as a victory by the unions and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nThe Times believes plans which would allow some GPs in England to charge patients for out-of hours appointments and minor surgical procedures are controversial but deserve a fair hearing.\n\nIt suggests it would be a simple way to offer more appointments as well as raising money that would help to pay for new doctors.\n\nHowever, the paper insists that safeguards would be needed to ensure that a sick person is always seen, regardless of their bank balance.\n\nThe author and former Royal Marine, Neal Ascherson, reveals in the Times how he shot two badly-wounded men in Malaya 65 years ago to - as he described it - \"put them out of their misery\".\n\nMr Ascherson tells the paper that he has spoken for the first time about what he had done to lend his support to the campaign to quash the conviction and sentence of a marine, Alexander Blackman, for murdering an injured Taliban fighter.\n\nHe says the conviction of Blackman is a \"piteous miscarriage of justice\".\n\nA number of papers showed Mary Berry punching the air after being named best television judge at the National TV Awards\n\nThe Sun expresses concern about a 15% rise in the number of people sleeping on the streets in England.\n\nIt says it is too easy to point the finger at Tory cuts, but it acknowledges that Labour is partly right to blame the government's housing strategy.\n\nFar too many people spend freezing winter nights on our streets, concludes the paper.\n\nIn short, it says, the government has to get to grips with this.\n\nMary Berry is known for her calm and genteel manner on the Great British Bake Off, but the Daily Telegraph is among a number of papers that show her punching the air with delight after being named best television judge at the National TV Awards.\n\nMiss Berry will not be on the programme when it moves to Channel Four.\n\nAnd according to the Mail she has ruled out an appearance on Strictly Come Dancing - saying her husband would leave her, and her children would chuck her out.",

Here's a look back at some first encounters of UK prime ministers and new US presidents:\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Gordon Brown's first meeting with Barack Obama came amid a global economic crisis\n\nThe election of Barack Obama came at the tail end of the Labour government.\n\nEmbroiled in both economic and political crisis, Gordon Brown spotted President Obama's election as an opportunity to be touched by the gold dust of the newly elected president.\n\nIn March 2009, Downing Street proudly boasted that Mr Brown was the first European leader President Obama had met.\n\nThe first meeting was dominated by the global financial crisis and the upcoming G20 summit in London.\n\nHowever, there was some embarrassment when President Obama gifted a box of US films to Brown - on DVDs that did not work on UK players.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The two leaders went on to form a close bond\n\nTony Blair and George W Bush's first summit came at a snowy Camp David - the US president's official retreat - seven months before the 9/11 attacks that would come to define their relationship.\n\nThe two leaders would eventually form a tight bond, with both countries going to war in Iraq despite the opposition of some European allies.\n\nBut the Camp David summit is remembered for something rather more trivial.\n\nUpon being asked what the two leaders had in common, President Bush replied: \"Well, we both use Colgate toothpaste.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. There were trade tensions between Europe and the US when the two leaders met\n\nThe first encounter between John Major and Bill Clinton was just a month after the president's inauguration.\n\nThere was a certain degree of nervousness before the meeting.\n\nMr Major had been a ferocious backer of George H W Bush in the 1992 presidential election.\n\nAnd between 1993 and 1997, the relationship between Mr Major and Mr Clinton never really blossomed.\n\nThey fell out over the US issuing a visa to Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams and the brewing conflict in the Balkans.\n\nThere are shades of the present-day debate in the BBC's Martin Sixmith's report, as he says trade tensions between the European Community and the USA, and accusations of protectionism, are a \"cloud\" over Mr Major's visit.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nMargaret Thatcher and president-elect George H W Bush's first official visit took place during her trip to Washington DC in November 1988.\n\nThe visit was planned before the election to say goodbye to her ally Ronald Reagan, and the BBC report at the time wondered whether her relationship with President Bush could be \"as special\".\n\nShe spent some time with the incoming president to discuss the end of the Cold War and the tensions in the Gulf.\n\nA year after she left Downing Street, President Bush invited Thatcher back to the White House to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award of the United States.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nWhen Margaret Thatcher met President Reagan just a month into his presidency, they weren't strangers - their first meeting took place in 1975, when he was the former governor of California and she was leader of the UK opposition.\n\nIn 1981, the British economy was entering its sixth quarter of recession, and her government seemed on course for electoral defeat.\n\nAt her lowest point, no-one placed themselves by her side as much as the incoming president of the United States, who made her his administration's first visitor and treated her with a warm welcome, in stark contrast to the frugality of his predecessor, Jimmy Carter.\n\nMargaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan became political soulmates and good friends.\n\n\"Your problems,\" said the British prime minister, \"will be our problems, and when you look for friends, we shall be there.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. James Callaghan flew to Washington to meet new US president Jimmy Carter\n\nJames Callaghan's arrival in Washington - on Concorde - came amid an ongoing siege nearby, which led to the cancellation of the traditional 19-gun salute in case it alarmed the gunman.\n\nBut there was still \"a very relaxed feeling\" about the ceremony, the BBC reported.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter hailed the special relationship between the two nations, while James Callaghan said \"concerted intergovernmental action\" was needed for the global economy to emerge from recession.\n\nHe promised a \"very warm welcome\" when the US president visited London.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Harold Wilson meets new US President Richard Nixon in 1969\n\nThe Labour prime minister and the Republican president were poles apart, both politically and in their approach.\n\nRichard Nixon recoiled from Harold Wilson's suggestion, made at their first meeting in London in February 1969, that the two men use each other's first names.\n\nAnother incident had ratcheted up the tension.\n\nBefore the 1968 election, when Mr Nixon was expected to lose to vice-president Hubert Humphrey, Mr Wilson appointed his old ally John Freeman as ambassador in Washington.\n\nUnfortunately, Mr Freeman had once described Mr Nixon as a \"man of no principle\", and the president was not best pleased.\n\nMr Freeman offered to resign, but Mr Wilson said he should stay.\n\nFortunately, at a banquet on his visit to Britain, Mr Nixon greeted the ambassador with generosity.\n\nMr Wilson wrote the president a note thanking him for \"one of the kindest and most generous acts I have known in a quarter of a century in politics\".\n\nOn his trip to Britain, Mr Nixon also visited ministers in Downing Street and came for one-on-one talks at Chequers.\n\nThe president enjoyed his visit, and was soon writing notes to \"Dear Harold\" and signing them off \"Dick Nixon\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAfter their first meeting, in April 1961 Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and President John F Kennedy were close allies, despite the stark contrast between the ageing British patrician and the glamorous president 23 years his junior.\n\nHarold Macmillan was said to have a very real and lasting affection for a man who was of the same generation as his own son, Maurice.\n\nAccording to his biographer, Macmillan watched JFK on the national stage with \"a combination of nervousness and pride an accomplished actor might feel for a mercurial young protege stepping up to take his first starring role in public\".\n\nWinston Churchill and Dwight Eisenhower, seen together in Bermuda in 1953\n\nWinston Churchill arrived in New York to a rapturous reception.\n\nHe met President-elect Dwight Eisenhower at the apartment of Bernard Baruch, a wealthy businessman, on two separate occasions in the weeks before the inauguration.\n\nThey came from different backgrounds, Mr Eisenhower, a Kansas boy, born in a shack beside the railroad tracks in rural Texas, and Mr Churchill, a British aristocrat, born in Blenheim Palace.\n\nYet they had a friendship that was forged in the darkest periods of World War Two and lasted until Churchill's death in 1965.",

            "content": "Levels of violence are up, staff numbers are down and complaints about overcrowding are widespread. Why are prisons in England and Wales under pressure?\n\n\"There's an incident at height - the prison's in lockdown.\"\n\nI was in the gate-lodge at High Down Prison in Surrey when a message came through from the governor.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice - which controls prisons in England and Wales - had, unusually, granted permission for me to visit a jail for a radio documentary about prison violence.\n\nThey had chosen High Down, a prison built on the site of an old mental hospital and now home to 1,100 male inmates.\n\nI waited in the visitors centre worried my visit might be cancelled, but half an hour later the incident had been resolved.\n\nIan Bickers, the High Down governor at the time of my visit in December 2014, brushed aside what had happened. A prisoner had clambered on to the safety netting under a landing because he was unhappy with the regime and wanted to move to another jail.\n\nMr Bickers explained that prisoner protests were a common occurrence, but required adept handling.\n\nAt that stage, High Down was on the edge of instability. Since then, a number of jails in England and Wales have fallen over the edge.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The footage is understood to have been filmed by inmates of HMP Birmingham\n\nThe recent disturbances at Lewes, Bedford, Birmingham and Swaleside prisons; the fatal stabbing of an inmate at Pentonville, followed by the escape of two of its prisoners; and the record number of prisoner suicides and assaults on staff all provide concrete evidence of the turmoil behind bars.\n\nIn 2015, in his last annual report as Chief Inspector of Prisons, Nick Hardwick said jails were in their worst state for a decade.\n\nLast year, David Cameron, in one of his final domestic policy speeches as prime minister, said reoffending rates and levels of prison violence, drug-taking and self-harm \"should shame us all\".\n\nEven Liz Truss, who as justice secretary has overall responsibility for prisons, acknowledges that they're \"not working\" and are under \"serious and sustained pressure\".\n\nThere have always been problems. For many years, internal reports painted a picture of daily outbreaks of violence, cell fires and self-harm across the prisons estate.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The aftermath of the 1990 Strangeways Prison riot\n\nThe worst disorder in the history of the prison service came in 1990 when two people died and hundreds were injured during rioting at Strangeways, in Manchester. It evolved into a 25-day protest against the squalid conditions and was followed by disturbances at eight other prisons.\n\nThe report into Strangeways was meant to be a watershed. It did lead to some improvements, including the beginning of the end of the practice of slopping out, where prisoners used chamber pots in their cells, but it did not herald an end to prison overcrowding.\n\nThe principal reason is numbers. England and Wales went from almost 45,000 prisoners in 1991 to 85,000 two decades later - an increase of nearly 90%.\n\nJustice and policing are devolved matters for Scotland and Northern Ireland. There has been nothing like the same rise in the jail population in Scotland, where the latest figure, around 7,200, is the lowest it has been for a decade. In Northern Ireland, there are some 1,500 people in custody, about 300 fewer than in the mid-1990s.\n\nSo why did numbers rise so steeply in England and Wales? Some lobby groups and criminologists point to a \"moral panic\" following the murder in 1993 of the toddler James Bulger.\n\nExperts describe a sentencing \"arms race\" between political parties vying to be the strongest on law and order. Former Conservative leader Michael Howard's \"prison works\" versus former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair's \"tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nWhatever the reasons, average sentence lengths have crept up, more offenders have been jailed for life or indeterminate terms and growing numbers of released prisoners have had to return to custody for breaching their licence conditions.\n\nNew jails have been built, but have not kept up with demand. The Prison Reform Trust (PRT) calculates that an average of 20,000 prisoners, almost a quarter of the total, are held in overcrowded conditions. Many share cells designed for one.\n\nAt times, when Labour was in power, there was so little spare capacity that cells at police stations and in court buildings were used to hold inmates. To ease the pressure, a scheme was introduced to let prisoners out up to 18 days before their standard release date, halfway through their sentence. Eighty-thousand inmates were freed under the scheme - in addition to those released early under an existing programme which required them to wear electronic tags.\n\nOvercrowding has a corrosive effect. It is, in the words of Strangeways report author Lord Woolf, \"a cancer eating at the ability of the prison service\" to deliver effective education, tackle offending behaviour and prepare prisoners for life on the outside.\n\nWhen the Coalition Government came to power in 2010 it began to look for savings, as part of its effort to reduce overall public spending. Five years later the National Offender Management Service (NOMS), which is responsible for prisons in England and Wales, had reduced its budget by nearly a quarter.\n\nWandsworth Prison is one of the country's most overcrowded\n\nOld jails that were expensive to operate were shut - 18 have closed since 2011.\n\nBut the other tactic in the efficiency drive has been a programme of \"benchmarking\".\n\nPublicly run jails are required to peg their costs to the same level as the most efficient prisons, including those in the private sector.\n\nFourteen jails in England and Wales, and two out of 15 prisons in Scotland, are operated by private firms - G4S, Serco and Sodexo. And benchmarking has certainly led to savings. The Ministry of Justice estimates that the average annual cost of a prison place fell by 20% between 2009-10 and 2015-16 to about \u00a335,000.\n\nBenchmarking has involved major changes to the regime in prisons and cuts to staffing. A standardised \"core day\" has been introduced in some jails, with the aim of making the most of prisoners' time out of their cells and giving them certainty about what activities they are doing.\n\nBut the Chief Inspector of Prisons, Peter Clarke, said jails which had brought in the new core days had not increased the amount of prisoners' time spent unlocked. Under half of jails were assessed as delivering \"good\" or \"reasonably good\" purposeful activities compared with more than two-thirds in 2009-10.\n\nWith the benchmarking programme and other cost-cutting, there was a dramatic reduction in staff numbers. Posts were cut in the Northern Ireland Prison Service as well, but in Scotland staff numbers have risen.\n\nThe overall number of staff employed across the public sector prison estate in England and Wales has fallen from 45,000 in 2010 to just under 31,000 in September 2016. Although a small part of the reduction has been because of employees switching to jails transferred to the private sector, the decline is substantial by any measure, with the number of prison officers working in key front-line roles down by more than 6,000.\n\nThe jobs market in areas such as London and south-east England has been so competitive that prisons have found it hard to attract and retain replacements on a \u00a320,500 starting salary. Many experienced prison officers have taken voluntary redundancy - with their know-how and jail-craft sorely missed. About 200 staff each month are brought in from other jails to work at prisons where vacancies cannot be filled.\n\nLast November, members of the Prison Officers Association took part in a 24-hour walkout in protest at what they said were the \"chronic staff shortages and impoverished regimes\" in jails which they claimed had resulted in staff no longer being safe.\n\nAs thousands of prison staff departed, a seemingly intractable drugs problem began to arrive in jails - \"legal highs\", also known as new psychoactive substances (NPS). Sold under names such as Spice and Black Mamba, by 2013 the synthetic cannabis compounds had become a major problem. In contrast, Scottish prisons have had no record of any seizures of the drug.\n\nSynthetic drugs are becoming an increasing problem in England's prisons\n\nThe health dangers, bizarre behaviour and violence associated with NPS led to them being banned in the UK last year. In prisons, they have proved to be an unpredictable, and occasionally lethal, alternative to cannabis. Between June 2013 and April 2016, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman identified 64 deaths in jail where the prisoner was known or strongly suspected to have used or possessed NPS before they died.\n\nDespite the dangers, these synthetic drugs are popular because they are hard to detect using conventional drug testing methods and they provide a diversion to the boredom and frustration of prison life. The drugs are a source of income for criminal gangs whose illicit use of phones and drones, combined with the help of a number of corrupt staff, has helped the trade thrive behind bars.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch a drone deliver drugs and mobile phones to London prisoners in April 2016\n\nThe destabilising impact of synthetic drugs, together with the loss of so many staff in such a short space of time, against a backdrop of overcrowding, has proved to be a dangerous cocktail for our prisons.\n\nThe government's policy document, entitled Prison Safety and Reform, published in November, acknowledges the scale of the challenge. An extra 2,500 prison officers are being recruited, there will be financial incentives for staff to stay in their jobs, while sniffer dogs and new methods of drug testing are being deployed.\n\nLabour said the announcement was \"too little, too late\", saying earlier staff cuts had created a \"crisis in safety\".\n\nAnd there are calls for far more radical measures.\n\nNick Clegg, deputy prime minister in the Coalition, together with the former Home Secretaries Jacqui Smith and Ken Clarke, said prisoner numbers must be steadily cut back to the levels of the early 90s, a reduction of some 40,000 inmates. \"We believe that an escalating prison population has gone well beyond what is safe or sustainable,\" they wrote in a letter to the Times.\n\nThere are no signs, however, that Liz Truss, the justice secretary, has any intention of arbitrarily cutting the jail population. Sentencing changes and early release schemes are simply not on her agenda.\n\nJustice Secretary Liz Truss wants to cut prisoner numbers by reducing reoffending\n\nMichael Spurr, the chief executive of NOMS, has even gone as far as to say that he cannot see an end to prison overcrowding until at least after the next parliament - 2025, at the earliest.\n\nInstead, Ms Truss believes that any drop in prisoner numbers should come through a reduction in reoffending - fewer people going through the revolving door of the criminal justice system.\n\nShe is hoping that extra staff and security improvements will steady the ship while longer-term changes to the management of prisons take effect. Governors will have greater autonomy, there will be closer monitoring of prison performance and education and investment in modern facilities.\n\nHMP Berwyn in north Wales will be the UK's biggest prison\n\nA new jail, HMP Berwyn, opens in north Wales next month. It has cost \u00a3250m to build and will house more than 2,000 male prisoners - making it the biggest prison in the UK.\n\nThe extra places will help relieve some of the pressure on a system that still relies heavily on jails constructed in the Victorian era. But more important, Berwyn sends a clear message that in spite of all the recent trouble, tensions and turmoil within prison walls, the government remains committed to the concept of imprisonment itself.\n\nUPDATE: The graphs in this piece were updated on 2 August to reflect new figures published\n\u2022 None How dangerous are our prisons?",

            "section": "US & Canada",
            "content": "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nPresident Trump has indicated that he is considering a return to the sort of harsh interrogation techniques of \"enemy combatants\" that have been widely condemned as torture, as well as a return to so-called CIA \"black sites\".\n\nIn his first interview since becoming US President, Mr Trump said intelligence officials had told him that \"torture absolutely works\", but that he would defer to advice from his new CIA director and his secretary of defence. The latter, retired Marine Corps officer Gen James Mattis, says torture does not work.\n\nSo what are the global implications if the president goes ahead, asks BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner.\n\nThere is a South African proverb, dating from the apartheid era, that goes like this: \"How do you catch an elephant? You catch a mouse and keep beating it up until it admits it's really an elephant.\"\n\nRidiculous as this may sound, there is an echo of truth here. Torture hurts. That's the whole point of it.\n\nSo if someone is tortured badly enough they will say anything to make it stop, including making things up that they think their tormentors will want to hear.\n\nPrisons in certain Middle Eastern countries, especially Syria, are crammed full of people who are being abused so badly they will eventually sign any \"confession\" to make the treatment stop. In some countries forced confessions remain to this day the primary tool in the prosecutor's armoury.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in 2001 the US intelligence community, having failed to prevent the worst attack on the US since Pearl Harbor, became convinced that a second catastrophic attack was on its way.\n\nAs President George W Bush's \"war on terror\" got underway, the normal safeguards of respect for human rights and the rule of law were cast aside in a desperate hunt to find \"the ticking bomb\".\n\nTop al-Qaeda planners like Ramzi Bin Al-Shibh, Abu Zubaydah and Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, all caught in Pakistan, were \"rendered\" (transported) to so-called \"black sites\" for extreme interrogation. These were secret, unacknowledged prisons, run by the CIA and scattered around the globe in Afghanistan, Thailand, Poland, Romania and other countries.\n\nThere they were subjected to repeated waterboarding, which makes the bound and helpless victim feel like they are drowning. Khaled Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded a staggering number of times, well over 100.\n\nAnd yet years later, when in 2014 the US Senate's Intelligence and Security Select Committee issued its report on the use of torture under the Bush administration it concluded that torture was \"not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees\".\n\nOn Thursday, the US House Speaker, Paul Ryan, said torture was not legal and that the committee agreed it was not legal. Senator John McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, also opposes it.\n\n\"The president can sign whatever executive order he likes,\" he said, \"but the law is the law. We are not bringing back torture in the USA.\"\n\nThere would be strong resistance too from both America's allies and from within the intelligence community itself.\n\nThere is a general acceptance now, in most of the world, that those practices carried out in the early years after the 9/11 attacks - extraordinary rendition, detention without trial, enhanced interrogation - were not only morally wrong, they were also counter-productive.\n\nThey very rarely produced useful, actionable intelligence. They traumatised not only the victims, some of whom were completely innocent, but also those who witnessed the shocking dehumanising of an individual. Undoubtedly this has given the green light to some unscrupulous practices by regimes who see America's earlier use of torture as a license to do what they like to their own citizens.\n\nUnthinkable as it sounds now, the US even rendered one \"high value detainee\" to his own country - Syria - for interrogation, knowing that there would be few restraints on his treatment there.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. John McCain said he'd have Donald Trump in court in 'a New York minute' if he reinstated waterboarding\n\nThere is also the legal aspect. In 2010 David Cameron, who was then UK prime minister, set up a judge-led, independent inquiry into allegations of complicity by MI5 and MI6 officers in torture.\n\nCareer intelligence officers who had thought they were doing the right thing at the time - such as, hypothetically, being within earshot of the harsh interrogation of a suspect in a Pakistani jail - found themselves being questioned by detectives from the Metropolitan Police.\n\nThe inquiry was eventually scrapped but it has at least led to a widespread rethink on respect for human rights inside intelligence agencies on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nSenior intelligence officers who lived through this difficult period are likely to strongly resist turning the clock back and returning to those days.\n\nIt is also questionable whether the US would find willing partners to host black site prisons amongst those countries only too relieved to have closed that chapter in their national histories.",

            "section": "UK Politics",
            "content": "Tam Dalyell was a political contradiction, an aristocratic Old Etonian who became a socialist politician.\n\nIt was he who articulated what became known as the West Lothian Question, which festered at the heart of Scotland's relationship with Westminster.\n\nA former Conservative activist, he became a thorn in the side of the Thatcher government.\n\nBut he won admiration from across the political spectrum as an honourable and principled member of parliament.\n\nThomas Dalyell Loch was born in Edinburgh on 9 August 1932.\n\nHis father Gordon Loch, a civil servant, adopted his wife Nora's maiden name in 1938.\n\nIt was through his mother that Dalyell later inherited the Dalyell baronetcy, although he never used the title.\n\nThe Suez crisis made him an opponent of British military intervention\n\nHe went to Eton before doing his National Service as a trooper with the Royal Scots Greys, having failed his officer training.\n\nAfter he was demobbed, he went to Cambridge where he was chairman of the University Conservative Association.\n\nIt was while working as a teacher that he experienced a political conversion, brought about by the Suez Crisis in 1956.\n\nThe debacle, in which Britain, together with Israel and France, unsuccessfully attempted to gain control of the Suez Canal, made a deep impression on him\n\nNot only did he join the Labour Party, but the aborted invasion made him a committed opponent of future British military involvement overseas.\n\nIn 1962, he won the seat of West Lothian in a by-election, fighting off a strong challenge from a future SNP leader, William Wolfe.\n\nLess than two years after he entered parliament, Dalyell was appointed parliamentary private secretary to Dick Crossman, then Minister for Local Government.\n\nDalyell (r) arrived at Westminster in 1962 as the newly elected member for West Lothian\n\nThe position of PPS was seen as the first step to a ministerial career, but Dalyell's independent stance on issues irritated the party establishment.\n\nThat irritation turned to anger in 1967 when he was heavily censured for leaking minutes of a select committee meeting about the Porton Down biological and chemical warfare establishment to the Observer newspaper.\n\nDalyell claimed he thought the minutes were in the public domain but he did not escape a public dressing-down by the Speaker.\n\nIn a parliamentary debate on devolution in 1977, Dalyell first proposed what would become known as the West Lothian Question.\n\nA vocal opponent of Scottish devolution, Dalyell contrasted the town of Blackburn in his own constituency, and Blackburn in Lancashire.\n\n\"For how long,\" he asked, \"will English constituencies and English Honourable Members tolerate at least 119 Honourable Members from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland exercising an important and often decisive effect on English politics?\"\n\nIt was Enoch Powell who coined the term West Lothian Question, in his response to Dalyell's speech.\n\nHe fought to uncover the truth about the Lockerbie bombing\n\nWhen Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979 she found Dalyell a persistent critic of her policies.\n\nHe supported the Troops Out movement in Northern Ireland and attacked the prime minister's proposed boycott of the Moscow Olympics.\n\nBut it was the Falklands War that raised his public profile. He described the conflict as \"like two bald men fighting over a comb,\" quoting the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges.\n\nHe strongly condemned the decision to sink the Argentine cruiser, General Belgrano, insisting the vessel had been steering away from the conflict when torpedoed by a British submarine.\n\nHis political opponents called him Daft Tam, ignoring the methodical and painstaking preparation he put into sourcing the facts to back up his arguments.\n\nHe was no slave to parliamentary protocol and was suspended from the House on numerous occasions, twice for calling Mrs Thatcher \"a liar\" over the Falklands campaign.\n\n\"She is a bounder, a liar, a deceiver, a cheat, a crook and a disgrace to the House of Commons,\" was one notable contribution during a 1987 debate.\n\nHowever, some felt that his intemperate language did nothing to win him support.\n\nFormer Conservative MP and later political commentator, Matthew Parris said that \"this element of personal vendetta seriously weakens his case\".\n\nDalyell was persistent in trying to uncover the truth about the Lockerbie bombing and consistently said he did not believe Libyan leader Colonel Gadaffi was responsible for the outrage.\n\nHe was, predictably, bitterly opposed to the Gulf War, \"Kuwait is the 19th bloody state of Iraq,\" and went to Baghdad in 1994 to negotiate with Iraqi foreign minister Tariq Aziz.\n\nThe election of a Labour government under Tony Blair in 1997 failed to deter Dalyell from speaking his mind.\n\nIn 1999, he decided that he would no longer vote at Westminster on purely English issues, defying a number of three-line whips.\n\nHe was one of 25 MPs who opposed military action in Kosovo. \"I am one of a dwindling number of MPs who have actually worn the Queen's uniform,\" he said.\n\nHe continued to live in the ancestral home\n\n\"Perhaps we are a bit less relaxed about unleashing war than those who have never been in a military situation.\"\n\nHe had little time for the New Labour project, describing Tony Blair as the worst of the eight prime ministers who had held power while he was a parliamentarian.\n\nIn 2001, he became Father of the House, the longest continuous serving MP, using his position to attack the US led invasion of Iraq.\n\n\"These are the thought processes of fantasist Americans who want to control the world,\" he said. \"I am appalled that a British Labour prime minister should have got into bed with a crew which has this moral standing.\"\n\nDalyell stood down from the House of Commons in 2005, after serving 43 years as an MP, first for West Lothian, then, from 1983, the redrawn constituency of Linlithgow.\n\nBehind Tam Dalyell's somewhat shambling and eccentric demeanour was a keen analytical brain and a passion for meticulous research.\n\nUnrepentant about his dogged approach, he claimed that \"you must not be afraid to be thought a bore\".\n\nHe was that rare thing among politicians, a man who stuck to his principles, regardless of how unpopular it made him.",
