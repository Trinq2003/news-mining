            "content": "Last updated on .From the section European Football\n\nCristiano Ronaldo was named the world's best player at the inaugural Best Fifa Football Awards in Zurich.\n\nReal Madrid and Portugal forward Ronaldo, 31, beat Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann to the prize.\n\nRonaldo also won the Ballon d'Or in December, with both honours recognition for success in the Champions League with Real and Euro 2016 with Portugal.\n\nCarli Lloyd of the United States was named the world's best female player.\n\nLeicester's Claudio Ranieri was named best men's coach, ex-Germany boss Silvia Neid won the female coach award, while Penang's Mohd Faiz Subri received the Puskas award for the best goal of 2016.\n\u2022 None Quiz: World's best - but who did he vote for?\n\nHold on... haven't we already had the Ballon d'Or?\n\nWe have - but this is different.\n\nFor the past six years, the world's best player has received the Fifa Ballon d'Or award.\n\nA version of that prize has been awarded by France Football magazine since 1956, but last year world football's governing body ended its association with that honour.\n\nInstead, it introduced the Best Fifa Football Awards, with Ronaldo the first recipient of its main prize.\n\nVoting for the player and coach categories was by national team captains and managers, selected journalists and, for the first time, an online poll of fans.\n\nEach counted for 25% of the points.\n\n2016 was quite a year for Ronaldo.\n\nAs well as scoring the decisive penalty in the shootout to win the Champions League, rescuing Real with a hat-trick in the final of the Club World Cup, captaining Portugal to Euro 2016 glory and being recognised with a fourth Ballon d'Or, he now has something Messi does not - the honour of being named best Fifa men's player.\n\nThe former Manchester United forward had been the favourite for the award, following a year in which he continued to deliver remarkable statistics. These included:\n\u2022 None The third best minutes-per-goal rate (83.68) of anyone scoring a minimum of 10 goals across Europe's top five leagues during 2016, behind Luis Suarez (82.57) and Radamel Falcao (59.6).\n\u2022 None Finishing top scorer in the Champions League in 2015-16 with 16 goals, seven more than second-placed Robert Lewandowski.\n\n\"It was my best year so far,\" said Ronaldo. \"The trophy for Portugal was amazing. I was so happy and of course I cannot forget the Champions League and the Club World Cup. We ended the year in the best way. I'm so glad to win a lot of trophies, collective and individual. I'm so, so proud.\"\n\nRonaldo and Messi have a history of not voting for each other for major awards and they continued that habit, both filling their top three with club-mates.\n\nMessi, the Argentina captain, went for Luis Suarez, Neymar and Andres Iniesta.\n\nDespite being on the shortlist for best individual player, Griezmann did not make the best XI.\n\nThe line-up features five players from Real Madrid, four from Barcelona, one from Juventus (Dani Alves, who was at Barca for the first half of 2016) and one, Manuel Neuer, from Bayern Munich.\n\nThat means no Premier League players were included.\n\nDespite the United States failing to finish on an Olympic podium for the first time, co-captain Carli Lloyd has continued her exceptional form both for her club, Houston Dash, and country.\n\nThe 34-year-old saw off competition from Germany's Olympic gold medallist Melanie Behringer and five-time winner Marta of Brazil.\n\n\"I honestly was not expecting this,\" said Lloyd. \"I know Melanie did fantastic in the 2016 Olympics.\"\n\nLeicester City manager Claudio Ranieri, who has also led his side to the last 16 of the Champions League this season, won the award ahead of Real Madrid's Zinedine Zidane, who lifted the Champions League in his first season in charge, and Portugal's Fernando Santos, who led his team to an unexpected success at Euro 2016.\n\nGermany's Silvia Neid retired in 2016 after capping an 11-year spell in charge of the national team by guiding them to Olympic gold for the first time.\n\nSuccess in Rio added to her extensive trophy collection, which includes the World Cup and two European Championships.\n\nThe best goal of 2016 was, officially, scored by Penang's Mohd Faiz Subri.\n\nIt came in the Malaysia Super League, the forward converting a superb, swirling free-kick from 35 yards which started out heading towards the top left corner but ended up in the top right.\n\nThe fan award went to supporters of Liverpool and German club Borussia Dortmund, who together sang a moving rendition of 'You'll Never Walk Alone' - an anthem adopted by both teams - before their Europa League quarter-final in April. The match came the day before the 27th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 Liverpool fans died.\n\nLiverpool went on to produce a stirring display, coming from behind to win the match 4-3 and advance to the semi-finals 5-4 on aggregate.\n\nColombian side Atletico Nacional were given the fair play award for their part in the aftermath of the plane crash which killed 19 players and staff of Brazilian side Chapecoense.\n\nChapecoense were en route to play the first leg of their Copa Sudamericana final when the plane crashed, killing 71 people.\n\nAtletico Nacional said the title should be awarded to Chapecoense. Fifa recognised their \"spirit of peace, understanding and fair play\".",

            "description": "Celebrated war correspondent who broke the news of Germany's invasion of Poland.",
            "section": "UK",
            "content": "Clare Hollingworth was the war correspondent who broke the news that German troops were poised to invade Poland at the start of World War Two.\n\nShe went on to report on conflicts across the world but it was that moment that defined her career.\n\nShe was by no means the first female war reporter, but her depth of technical, tactical and strategic insight set her apart.\n\nAnd, even as she approached her 11th decade, she still kept her passport by her bed in case she should be called to another assignment.\n\nClare Hollingworth was born in Leicester on 10 October 1911 and spent most of her childhood on a farm. What should have been idyllic years were overshadowed by World War One.\n\n\"I remember the German bombers flying over the farm we lived in to bomb Loughborough,\" she reminisced. \"And the next day we got Polly the pony and took the trap into Loughborough to see the damage they had done. \"\n\nShe had set her heart on a writing career early on, much to the exasperation of her mother.\n\nBritish authorities did not believe the German army had entered Poland\n\n\"She didn't believe anything journalists wrote and thought they were only fit for the tradesmen's entrance.\"\n\nAfter school she attended a domestic science college in Leicester, which instilled in her a lifelong hatred of housework.\n\nMore interesting to her by far were the battlefield tours that her father arranged to sites as diverse as Naseby, Poitiers and Agincourt.\n\nEschewing the prospect of life as a country squire's wife, Hollingworth became a secretary at the League of Nations Union before studying at London University's School of Slavonic Studies and the University of Zagreb.\n\nIn 1936 she married a fellow League of Nations worker, Vandeleur Robinson, but soon found herself in Warsaw, distributing aid to refugees who had fled from the Sudetenland, the Czech territory occupied by the Nazis in 1938.\n\nShe had written the occasional article for the New Statesman and, on a brief visit to London in August 1939, she was signed up by the editor of the Daily Telegraph, Arthur Wilson, who was impressed by her experience in Poland.\n\nIn this period of heightened tension, the border between Poland and Germany was sealed to all but diplomatic vehicles. After borrowing a car from the British consul in Katowice and proudly displaying the union jack, she drove through the exclusion zone and into Germany.\n\nShe had a deep knowledge of military strategy\n\nWhile driving back to Poland, having bought wine, torches and as much film as possible, she passed through a valley in which huge hessian screens had been erected.\n\nAs the wind blew one of the screens back, it revealed thousands of troops, together with tanks and artillery, all facing the Polish border.\n\nHer report featured on the front page of the Daily Telegraph on 29 August, 1939. Less than a week after becoming a full-time journalist, she had scooped one of the biggest stories of the 20th Century.\n\nThree days later, Hollingworth saw the German tanks rolling into Poland. But when she phoned the secretary at the British Embassy in Warsaw, he told her it could not be true as negotiations between Britain and Germany were still continuing.\n\n\"So I hung the telephone receiver out of the window,\" Hollingworth later recalled, \"So he could listen to the Germans invading.\"\n\nWorking on her own, often behind enemy lines, with nothing more than a toothbrush and a typewriter, she witnessed the collapse of Poland before moving to Bucharest, where she realised that her marriage was over.\n\n\"I thought that for me - and in a different kind of way for him - my career was more important than trying to rush back home,\" she reflected later.\n\nHer story about the spy Kim Philby was blocked by The Guardian\n\nHollingworth spent a busy war in Turkey, Greece and Cairo. When Montgomery - who could not stomach the idea of a woman reporting from the front - captured Tripoli in 1943, he ordered her to return to Cairo.\n\nShe decided to attach herself to Eisenhower's forces, then in Algiers.\n\nThough diminutive and bespectacled, Hollingworth was as tough as nails. She learned how to fly and made a number of parachute jumps.\n\nDuring the latter part of the war, she reported from Palestine, Iraq and Persia, where she interviewed the young Shah.\n\nAfter the war, Hollingworth, by now working for the Observer and the Economist, married Geoffrey Hoare, the Times's Middle East correspondent.\n\nThe couple were just 300 yards from Jerusalem's King David Hotel when it was bombed in 1946, killing 91 people.\n\nThe attack left her with a hatred of the man behind the attack, the Irgun leader Menachem Begin, who eventually became prime minister of Israel and won the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\"I would not shake a hand with so much blood on it,\" she explained.\n\nShe celebrated her 100th birthday in her adopted home of Hong Kong\n\nIn 1963 Hollingworth was working for the Guardian in Beirut when Kim Philby, a correspondent for the Observer, disappeared.\n\nShe was convinced that he was the fabled \"third man\" in a British spy ring that already included Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean.\n\nAfter some detective work, she discovered that Philby had left on a Soviet ship bound for Odessa and filed copy to that effect with the Guardian.\n\nBut this second huge scoop was spiked by the paper's editor, Alastair Hetherington, who feared a libel suit.\n\nThree months later, the Guardian ran the story, tucked away on an inside page. The following day the Daily Express splashed it on the front page, prompting the government to admit that Philby had, indeed, defected to the Soviet Union.\n\nHollingworth reported on the Algerian crisis and the Vietnam War. She was one of the first journalists to predict that American military muscle would not prevail and that a stalemate was inevitable.\n\nShe made a special effort to speak to Vietnamese civilians, away from the watching eyes of the US PR people, to ensure she accurately captured the views of those who were suffering the most.\n\nHoare died in 1966, and Hollingworth, who had become the Telegraph's first Beijing correspondent in 1973, retired to Hong Kong in 1981.\n\nShe spent her final years in the former colony and was a daily fixture at the Foreign Correspondents' Club, venerated by her colleagues.\n\nAlthough she lost her sight later in life, Clare Hollingworth, a true journalist's journalist, retained an acute interest in world affairs right to the end.\n\nShe was once asked where she would want to go if the phone rang with a new assignment.\n\n\"I would look through the papers,\" she said, \"And say, 'Where's the most dangerous place to go?', because it always makes a good story.\"",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "The claim: Levels of inequality in the UK have been getting worse.\n\nReality Check verdict: Official figures suggest that income distribution has become less unequal over the past decade.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday morning that he would be interested in a cap on earnings, because \"we cannot go on creating worse levels of inequality\".\n\nCoincidentally, Tuesday morning also saw the release of the annual report on income inequality from the Office for National Statistics.\n\nIt said that there had been a gradual decline in income inequality over the past decade.\n\nIt is using the Gini Coefficient, which is a measure of inequality - in this case, a coefficient of zero would mean that all households had the same income while 100 would mean that one household had all the income.\n\nThese figures are for disposable income, which is what you get after you've added benefits and subtracted direct taxes such as income tax and council tax.\n\nThere are caveats around these figures - they are based on surveys, so there is a margin of error, and it is particularly difficult to get survey responses from people at the top of the income distribution.\n\nBut the official figures suggest that there was a considerable increase in inequality in the 1980s, relatively little change from the early 1990s to mid-2000s and then a gradual decline in the past decade, returning the UK to the same level of inequality as was seen in the mid-1980s.\n\nSo from these figures it would be wrong to conclude that inequality has been getting worse.\n\nWhat could be missing from this analysis? The ONS looks at inequality across the whole population - there has also been much interest in comparing the richest 1% or 0.1% with the rest of the population.\n\nThe World Top Incomes Database (which you can see in figure 3 of this blog) suggests that since 1990 there has been relatively little change in the share of income taken by the richest 20% or 10% of the population.\n\nThe richest 1% and the richest 0.1% had seen their share of income rising steadily until the financial crisis, but it has fallen since then. So once again, inequality has not been growing.\n\nThe measures identified so far have been looking at income rather than wealth.\n\nIt is also possible to calculate Gini coefficients for wealth, although the latest official figures for it covered only up to the middle of 2014.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2014, there was a small increase in overall wealth inequality, with property wealth having the biggest effect.\n\nHousing costs are a particular issue - the Department for Work and Pensions calculates a Gini coefficient for income distribution that takes housing costs into account.\n\nThe difference it makes is that inequality increases in 2013-14, although it is still below pre-financial crisis levels.\n\nNone of this suggests that inequality does not exist in the UK or that it is not a problem or indeed that it is not worse than in other countries, but there is little evidence that it has been getting worse in the UK in the past decade.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "section": "UK Politics",
            "content": "Theresa May has set out her vision for a \"shared society\" in which the state has a role in helping people who are struggling to get by. It marks the latest attempt by a Conservative leader to spell out what society should, or should not, be.\n\nMargaret Thatcher's remark about society was one of her most famous\n\nIn a 1987 interview with Woman's Own magazine, Margaret Thatcher said there was \"no such thing as society\", and that line went on to become one of her most famous.\n\nIt has been much debated over the years, with critics seeing it as evidence of a heartless approach where needy individuals are left to fend for themselves.\n\nBut Thatcher's supporters complain the quote is taken out of context, and in her memoirs the former PM said it had been \"distorted beyond recognition\".\n\nMore recently, polling has found that while a strong majority of people disagreed with the \"no such thing\" line in isolation, most agreed with the longer version.\n\nHere it is: \"I think we've been through a period where too many people have been given to understand that if they have a problem, it's the government's job to cope with it... They're casting their problem on society.\n\n\"And, you know, there is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families, and no government can do anything except through people, and people must look to themselves first.\n\n\"It's our duty to look after ourselves and then, also, to look after our neighbour. People have got the entitlements too much in mind, without the obligations. There's no such thing as entitlement, unless someone has first met an obligation.\"\n\nThatcher's successor, John Major, entered Downing Street in 1990 promising to create a \"classless society\", which he described as a \"a tapestry of talents in which everyone from child to adult respects achievement\".\n\nHe was still talking about it in his party conference speech the following year: \"I spoke of a classless society. I don't shrink from that phrase.\n\n\"I don't mean a society in which everyone is the same, or thinks the same, or earns the same. But a tapestry of talents in which everyone from child to adult respects achievement; where every promotion, every certificate is respected; and each person's contribution is valued. And where the greatest respect is reserved for the law.\"\n\nNext up was William Hague, who called for a \"responsible society\", and said Thatcher's famous line had been wilfully misinterpreted and used against the Conservatives.\n\n\"A strong society rests on responsible individuals and families. They need to be able to turn to straightforward, reliable help when times are bad,\" the Tories' 2001 manifesto said.\n\n\"But that should not become dependence on the state when times are good.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. David Cameron: \"I think we're onto a really big idea, a really exciting future for our country\"\n\n\"There is such a thing as society; it's just not the same thing as the state,\" declared David Cameron in his 2005 victory speech after becoming Conservative leader.\n\nFive years later, the idea of a Big Society was a key strand of the Conservatives' 2010 general election manifesto.\n\nIt involved allowing voluntary groups and charities to run public services, encouraging people to do more volunteering and giving local groups more power to take decisions affecting their area.\n\nAfter becoming PM, Cameron described building the Big Society as his \"great passion\", hoping \"people power\" would help keep pubs and museums open and mean more residents getting involved with their communities.\n\nBut there were reports Conservative candidates found it a hard concept to explain on the doorstep, and the Tories' political opponents said it was simply a way of hiding cuts to local services as the new government reduced public spending.\n\nMentions of the Big Society became less prominent over the course of the Parliament, and the theme featured little in the 2015 general election campaign.\n\nHaving quit frontline politics after the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Cameron now works with the National Citizen Service, describing the organisation as \"the Big Society in action\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Prime Minister Theresa May said she wanted to \"build a better Britain\"\n\nIn what has been seen as a break from David Cameron's championing of voluntary work, Theresa May has stressed the role of the state in creating \"a society that works for everyone\".\n\nThe so-called shared society, she says, \"doesn't just value our individual rights but focuses rather more on the responsibilities we have to one another\" and respects \"the bonds of family, community, citizenship and strong institutions that we share as a union of people and nations\".\n\nIn a speech setting out her vision, she said there was \"more to life than individualism and self-interest\".\n\n\"We form families, communities, towns, cities, counties and nations. And we embrace the responsibilities those institutions imply.\n\n\"And government has a clear role to play to support this conception of society.\"",

            "description": "Could a tank developed by twin brothers Mike and Geoff Howe become the latest luxury must-have?",

Dealing with the luxury market is \"a learning curve\", says Geoff Howe\n\nSome of the very rich like to go further than just displaying their wealth. They want things that few others can have, such as vehicles like an armour-plated SUV.\n\nAnd now there's another extreme machine aimed at the moneyed motor-mad: the EV2.\n\n\"It's a luxury, high-speed vehicle,\" explains one of its makers, Mike Howe.\n\n\"You hit a button and the gull-wing doors pop up just like a Lamborghini. Inside you have eight-way leather seats, reverse camera, cameras up top, state of the art tracks, state of the art suspension...\"\n\nIn fact, according to Mike's twin brother Geoff, the EV2 is a \"luxurious tank\". That's because the machine has tracks like a tank, rather than wheels.\n\nTwin brothers Geoff (left) and Mike Howe began building and inventing things while still at school\n\nThe brothers claim that, thanks to its tracks, their vehicle can move at high speed across all kinds of rugged terrain in a similar fashion to its military counterpart - but unlike the latter, the EV2 is devoid of armaments.\n\nThey say that there is demand for the product. However, the luxury market is a new departure for them, and a far cry from their normal line of business.\n\nThe brothers trace the origin of their enterprise (based in Maine, in the US) all the way back to their childhood.\n\n\"We were always pushing the envelope,\" recalls Geoff.\n\n\"We built our own log cabin because the other kids down the street had a tree house that their father helped build. Mike and I didn't have a father figure at the time. So we had to do it on our own. We wanted to make it bigger, better.\"\n\nAs time passed, they graduated from log cabins to unusual vehicles, such as off-road racers.\n\nIn their college years, they converted a tour bus into a mobile stage for their rock and roll band.\n\nThanks to its tracks, their vehicle can move at high speed across all kinds of rugged terrain, the brothers claim\n\nLater, they became obsessed with the idea of building an extremely fast, tracked vehicle. After years of work, they ended up creating a small tank, which they called the Ripsaw.\n\nThe device caught the attention of the US Army, which eventually ordered manned and unmanned versions for research and development.\n\nAs a result of the US military's interest, the brothers were able to turn their hobby into a business.\n\nThe challenges they faced in creating the Ripsaw were formidable.\n\nThe company also invented the Ripchair, an off-road wheelchair with tracks\n\nFor example, the faster you try to make a tracked vehicle go, the more likely you are to lose a track. \"It's like a wheel coming off on a car,\" explains Mike.\n\nEngineering problems like these proved tough to solve. The brothers looked beyond the automotive world for answers, and took lessons from elsewhere, such as from the technology employed in chainsaws.\n\nAs they gained experience, they expanded their range to include products like robotic systems that could help to disable bombs, and the Ripchair, an extraordinary off-road wheelchair with tracks.\n\nHollywood also began to take an interest, and the brothers' vehicles have appeared in several big-budget pictures, like GI Joe 2 and Mad Max: Fury Road.\n\nIt was collaboration with the movie industry that led to a new direction for the business.\n\nThe brothers see luxury forming only a small part of their range\n\nOne day, the brothers received a call from someone working for a wealthy individual who had seen one of their vehicles on screen, and wanted a bespoke leisure version of the Ripsaw.\n\nThey were at first surprised by the request, but after careful consideration, they decided to give the idea a go. The result was the EV2.\n\nThey find dealing with the luxury market a whole new challenge.\n\nOne of the biggest difficulties is establishing clear lines of communication. He is rarely able to talk directly to the end client - so it is vital to ensure that the customer's wishes are being met, rather than those of any intermediaries.\n\nThe company has also made robotic systems to help disable bombs\n\nThe brothers have found that clients in this market are interested in a range of options.\n\nIn addition to those already mentioned, they include a night vision and thermal imaging system, which displays images of the road ahead and around the vehicle.\n\n\"You can shut all the lights off at night and the vehicle is completely dark and you can run 60 miles an hour down the road and see everything you need to see to be able to drive safely,\" says Mike.\n\nSome of the tanks are equipped with thermal imaging or night vision\n\nHe adds that it's up to the client to establish where and how the vehicle can be driven safely and legally.\n\nThe high cost of EV2 (a typical model costs hundreds of thousands of dollars) presents another challenge.\n\nBecause so much money is at stake, the brothers sometimes need to do some delicate checking on potential customers, to establish that they are able to afford the cost.\n\nThey say they have enjoyed adding a \"luxury\" product to their portfolio - but they do not want it to end up skewing the direction of the whole business, which is why they see it forming only a small part of their range in future.\n\nThis approach is wise, says author and consultant Peter York, who has advised many large luxury enterprises.\n\nLuxury tanks will only form a small part of the business, the twins say\n\n\"If you start spending time on billionaires' private fantasies then there are immense opportunity costs.\n\n\"A technologically innovative business and a luxury business are very different,\" he says.\n\nStill, the brothers are always open to new ideas, and for a special client, they will continue to push the envelope.\n\nAt present they are working on a variant with 2,000 horsepower - nearly four times the power of a standard EV2.\n\n\"We have no idea how it's going to work out,\" says Mike Howe. \"We're riding that edge between what's physically possible and what's a dream.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "section": "Middle East",
            "content": "Iraqi forces have gained ground since launching a \"second phase\" in the operation\n\nThe announcement by the Iraqi military that its forces have reached the Tigris River for the first time in the battle for Mosul marks a significant moment in the 12-week campaign to recapture so-called Islamic State's (IS) last major stronghold in the country.\n\nLieutenant General Abdal-Amir al-Lami, the Iraqi deputy chief of staff for operations, confirmed on 8 January that the Iraqi security forces (ISF) had seized the eastern end of one of the bridges linking the two sides of the city.\n\nA solid foothold seems to have been made in the riverside Beladiyat area, which is the site of many of Mosul's newer municipality offices and the Salam Hospital, the scene of a daring earlier attempt by Iraqi forces to punch a corridor through to the river.\n\nNorth of Beladiyat, the 2nd Iraqi Special Operations Forces (ISOF) brigade experienced a simultaneous breakthrough towards the river in the Muthana neighbourhood and the ancient ruins of Nineveh.\n\nGains are also being made in north-east Mosul, as the 1st and 3rd ISOF brigades attempt the recapture of the Kindi military base and adjacent upper income neighbourhoods.\n\nBroad-based advances suggest that IS resistance is \"showing signs of collapse\" in east Mosul, as suggested by Brett McGurk, the senior US official in the counter-IS coalition, in a tweet on 8 January.\n\nOne causal factor was clearly the concentration of all available ISF forces in east Mosul, achieved by closing down ancillary assaults north and south-west of the city.\n\nDuring a two-week hiatus the 2nd Emergency Response Brigade and 5th Federal Police division troops were shifted from areas south-west of Mosul to new positions east of the Tigris.\n\nThese forces re-energised the ISF thrust towards Beladiyat and the bridges inside the city when the offensive was restarted on 29 December.\n\nAnother accelerant was the coalition's role in reconfiguring the Iraqi battle plan, fostering greater co-ordination between Iraqi headquarters and providing more powerful artillery and air strikes.\n\nThe latter boost in firepower required US howitzers to be deployed at the eastern edges of Mosul city.\n\nOver 400 coalition special forces were inserted into the urban battle as advisers and strike co-ordinators, often well within the range of IS attacks.\n\nSteady advances in east Mosul will provide a welcome bright spot as the gruelling battle for the city enters its 12th week.\n\nIraqi forces are now present in 35 of east Mosul's 47 neighbourhoods, including the largest and most densely populated parts of the east side.\n\nThousands of Iraqis have fled the fighting, though not as many as some predictions\n\nHard fighting may still be ahead for Mosul University and the Kindi army base, both of which are in east Mosul.\n\nNone of the 29 large and heavily populated west Mosul neighbourhoods have been liberated.\n\nUnless an unexpectedly rapid collapse of IS unfolds, the western side of the city will need to be assaulted in a separate military operation launched after some weeks of reset and planning for the ISF.\n\nThis suggests that east Mosul may be cleared in January 2017 or early February, whilst the clearance of west Mosul may stretch well into the second quarter of 2017.\n\nThe sequential clearing of different quarters of Mosul city may succeed in limiting the time that civilians are exposed to intense combat in individual neighbourhoods.\n\nThus far the battle has seen far less damage done to Mosul's infrastructure than previous attritional struggles like Ramadi in Iraq or Kobane in Syria, though the daily damage to neighbourhoods has intensified since the offensive restarted.\n\nFrame from video by Amaq news agency appearing to show a collapsed section of the Old Bridge\n\nThe coalition has specifically sought to minimise the cost and time required to rebuild bridges, selectively destroying easy-to-replace spars and off-ramps to deny the bridges to IS but to leave them quickly repairable after the battle.\n\nThe number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) from Mosul city itself was estimated by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs at 42,000 in early December, around 4-6% of Mosul's remaining population and a far lower number than many pre-battle projections.\n\nThe flow of IDPs from the city has increased since 29 December according to OCHA, including 15,942 in the eight days after the offensive restarted. However, OCHA also announced that security in liberated areas has also allowed 14,000 IDPs to return to Mosul city.\n\nAway from most media coverage, the liberated zones of east Mosul city are witnessing the gradual return of policing, running water and diesel-run neighbourhood electrical generation networks.\n\nMost important, the cross-sectarian and multi-ethnic ISF in Mosul city have broadly been accepted by local Sunni Arab residents, who seem grateful for their largely humane treatment of the population and their sacrifices in coming to the distant northern Sunni city of Mosul to liberate it from IS.\n\nIS is expected to step up attacks in other parts of Iraq as it loses hold of Mosul\n\nThe most likely IS response to the loss of east Mosul will be efforts to intensify anti-civilian bombings in Baghdad, where seven bombings in the first eight days of 2017 have killed 87 people and wounded as many as 231.\n\nThe Iraqi government and coalition are currently building up Baghdad's perimeter defences, installing sensors on tethered blimps and launching disruptive security operations in the rural outskirts of the city to break up bombing cells.\n\nDr Michael Knights is the Lafer Fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He has worked in all of Iraq's provinces, and spent time embedded with the Iraqi security forces.
