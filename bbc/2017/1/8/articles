            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nThe youngest Liverpool starting line-up in the club's history were held to a frustrating draw by resolute League Two side Plymouth Argyle in their FA Cup third-round tie at Anfield.\n\nThe hosts, whose side had an average age of 21 years and 296 days, had 80.3% possession in the first half but struggled to break down their gritty opponents, with Sheyi Ojo failing to take their best chance when he missed a header from close range.\n\nDivock Origi also had a goal disallowed for a foul on Gary Miller before Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp brought on first-team regulars Daniel Sturridge, Adam Lallana and Roberto Firmino in search of a breakthrough.\n\nSturridge sent a 25-yard shot just wide, looped a header over and fired into the side-netting - but the Reds could not find the cutting edge to break down an organised and disciplined Plymouth.\n\nCraig Tanner would have been clean through on the Liverpool goal but for a Kevin Stewart challenge as the Pilgrims earned a replay at Home Park.\n\nBoth sides now go into the fourth round draw, which will be made live on BBC Two and online from 19:00 GMT on Monday.\n\u2022 None Watch all of the latest FA Cup highlights and reaction here\n\u2022 None All the FA Cup third-round reports in one place\n\nLiverpool boss Klopp made 10 changes for the game - including defender Joe Gomez returning to first-team action for the first time since 1 October, 2015 following a knee ligament injury, and 17-year-old forward Ben Woodburn making his first start for the club.\n\nAnd, despite his side enjoying plenty of possession - 87.2% after the first 15 minutes - they could not find the creativity to pierce the banked masses of Plymouth players.\n\nOjo failed to make proper contact with a header from five yards and Woodburn - showing some neat footwork at times - had a shot saved, but chances were few and far between for the youthful Reds, who managed just four efforts on target from 28 overall.\n\nGerman Klopp said before the game he could be criticised if his team selection backfired and, even with the introduction of Sturridge, Lallana and Firmino, his much-changed side could not find a winner.\n\nSuch was the effort and application put in by Plymouth, who are second in League Two, Klopp congratulated their players on the pitch after the final whistle.\n\nThe visitors set up in a 4-5-1 formation and their focus on containment rather than posing any attacking threat resulted in keeper Luke McCormick having the most touches - 52 - of any Pilgrims player.\n\nIt was a team effort, but centre-backs Sonny Bradley and Yann Songo'o epitomised the dogged spirit and endeavour of their side and were key to the result.\n\nPlymouth took nearly 9,000 fans to Anfield and, although they had little to cheer from an attacking point of view with their team managing just three touches in the Liverpool box, they were celebrating at the end and have a replay to look forward to at Home Park.\n\n\"The character and work rate we showed was unbelievable,\" said Plymouth midfielder Graham Carey.\n\n\"The atmosphere has been brilliant and it will be the same when they come to our place. I've come here as a fan before - the hairs are standing up on the back of my neck.\"\n\nWhat they said:\n\nLiverpool manager Klopp: \"They created small spaces and we made our own problems. A game like this is not easy to make exciting.\n\n\"We had a young side so that's difficult. We can do better and if we do better then we have a good chance of making the next round.\n\n\"With our other line-up it could be possible that the result was still the same - not likely, but possible. It was a good experience for the boys.\"\n\nPlymouth boss Derek Adams: \"We had a very good defensive display. We allowed Liverpool the ball. When we had the ball we still created a couple of opportunities.\n\n\"We had gone in at half-time at 0-0 and that was important. We knew Liverpool might start the second half at a better tempo and we coped with that well. We knew we would get a bit of belief as well.\n\n\"We've had a couple of opportunities in the game that we might have done better with, but that would be asking too much.\"\n\nOn an injury to Gary Miller: \"He's either got a broken ankle or ankle ligament damage. We'll see what happens. It's disappointing for him and the team.\"\n\nFormer Wales and Arsenal striker John Hartson on BBC Radio 5 live\n\n\"Plymouth gave everything. They have left everything out there on the Anfield pitch.\n\n\"Liverpool paid the price for too many changes. They never really created enough opportunities for their strikers. It's a day to give Plymouth the credit.\"\n\u2022 None The Reds have drawn four of their past five FA Cup matches at Anfield 0-0.\n\u2022 None Liverpool had 76.7% on Sunday. Only against Burnley and Sunderland in the Premier League this season have they had more in a game.\n\u2022 None The last fourth-tier side to claim a draw in an FA Cup game at Anfield were Doncaster Rovers in January 1974.\n\u2022 None The Pilgrims avoided defeat in an FA Cup game against a top-flight team for the first time since drawing against Everton in the fourth round in 1989 (before losing the replay).\n\u2022 None Liverpool midfielder Kevin Stewart made the same amount of successful passes (53) as the whole Plymouth team during the first half.\n\nLiverpool go to Southampton on Wednesday for the first leg of their EFL Cup semi-final (19:45 GMT kick-off), while Plymouth continue their League Two promotion challenge when they host Stevenage on Saturday at 15:00.\n\u2022 None Attempt blocked.

            "section": "US & Canada",
            "content": "As the 70th anniversary of the Black Dahlia murder approaches the public fascination with Elizabeth Short and her grisly unsolved death hasn't dimmed. James Bartlett takes a look at how Los Angeles remembers the famous murder.\n\nFew people noticed the dark-haired woman when she was dropped off at the swanky Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, but when her torso was found nearly a week later, Elizabeth Short became a household name.\n\nOn the morning of 15 January 1947, Betty Bersinger was walking with her young daughter along a barely developed street in the planned neighbourhood of Leimert Park when she saw what she thought was two halves of a tailor's mannequin.\n\nShort had been cut in two, neatly at the waist, and drained of blood. She had been mutilated, her intestines removed, and her mouth slashed from ear to ear - a gruesome cut known as a Glasgow Smile. Her body had then been washed clean before being dumped in an empty field.\n\nAn ensuing media frenzy followed, thanks to the \"brutal, misogynistic and ritual nature\" of the killing, says Glynn Martin, former Los Angeles police sergeant and historian. More than 50 suspects were interviewed, both male and female - some of whom confessed to the crime. But the murder was never solved, only adding to the crime's mystique.\n\nThere was also the connection to the glamour of the area.\n\n\"She lived in Hollywood, had aspirations to be an actress,\" Martin says.\n\nThe murder became \"a sad cliche - the ultimate warning tale\".\n\n\"A starry-eyed young girl comes to Hollywood, and things go very bad for her,\" he says.\n\nThen, of course, there was the memorable nickname, a twist on the previous year's Veronica Lake-Alan Ladd film The Blue Dahlia, and reference to Short's striking dark hair.\n\nIn the decades since, the Black Dahlia case has inspired university theses, art projects and the name of a death metal band, as well as references in video games and television shows. In 2006, it even got the major motion picture treatment, an adaptation of James Ellroy's best-selling novel inspired by the case.\n\nEllroy himself says he doesn't have any hope the culprit will be found.\n\n\"It's never going to be solved because it was not meant to be solved,\" he says.\n\nKim Cooper and her husband Richard Schave run Esotouric's literary, crime and culture bus tours of Los Angeles, and Cooper says that many people who come on their Black Dahlia tour \"have their heads full of misinformation\".\n\n\"While we debunk the many theories about possible killers, we try to focus on the story of Elizabeth Short as a person.\"\n\nBut even the tour operators can be surprised, like when an older man joined one of their true crime tours, claiming a connection to the Black Dahlia.\n\n\"He told us that he had been a paper boy at the time, and had rushed to be one of the first at the crime scene. It was the first naked woman he ever saw,\" Cooper says.\n\n\"I think it affected the rest of his life.\"\n\nLike the 19th Century killings by Jack the Ripper in London, Short's murder continues to bring forth new theories.\n\nMost recently, Steve Hodel, a former homicide detective, claimed his physician father George was the killer, and also responsible for other notable murders.\n\nA cadaver dog searched Hodel's former home in 2013 and seemingly \"alerted\" for human remains - though, of course, Short's body had long been found.\n\nDuring my research for Gourmet Ghosts, a series of true crime books, I found that many talkative Los Angeles bartenders claim their joint was actually the last place Short was seen alive, not the Biltmore.\n\nSome theorised her murder was the result of a date turned violent, or that the perennially-broke Short left to hitchhike home, a common practice at the time, and got into the wrong car.\n\n\"I was regularly asked about the Black Dahlia on the reference desk,\" says Christina Rice, senior librarian of the photo collection at the Los Angeles Public Library. One woman came in looking for maps from 1947 because \"she was going to use her psychic abilities to solve the murder\".\n\nThe only copy of the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner's microfiche for the second half of January was stolen years ago, Rice says, adding Short was just one of many women brutally killed in the post-war years in California.\n\nThe Biltmore, where you can buy a Black Dahlia cocktail\n\nAs soon as the corpse was discovered, the Los Angeles Herald-Express and the sensationalist Los Angeles Examiner made full use of the cosy relationship that all newspapers had with the Los Angeles police department.\n\nAt the time it was common to see suicide notes and bloodstained bodies - albeit sometimes airbrushed or altered, like Short's naked body, onto which photo editors superimposed a blanket - on the front page. Suicide photographs even added arrows showing how victims had taken their final fall.\n\nThe Examiner also added complete fabrications to the Black Dahlia story, exchanging in their reporting the suit Short had been seen wearing for a tight skirt and blouse and implying sexual misadventures.\n\nThe newspaper also deceived Short's mother about her daughter's death, using a ruse about \"Beth\" winning a beauty contest, then flying her to Los Angeles before telling her the real news - ensuring the scoop of a mother responding to the tragedy.\n\nOfficially the case remains open, and today, the Biltmore Hotel serves a Black Dahlia cocktail of vodka, Chambord black raspberry liqueur and Kahlua. The drink, perhaps appropriately, tastes bitter.\n\nJames Bartlett is a writer and author of Gourmet Ghosts.",

I thought we were in total control in the first half, and pretty much hanging on for dear life in the last 10 minutes.\n\n\"You know the players Leicester have got, they are a proud bunch and never know when they are beaten.\n\n\"I am pleased we have won - I don't want to downplay that - but we constantly talk about learning from every game.\"\n\nLeicester head coach Aaron Mauger: \"I don't think you could ever question the character of our guys. We talked about playing for each other before we got on the bus.\n\n\"I was really proud of the way the guys responded in the second half. I thought we put ourselves in a situation to win the game.\n\n\"There was a lot of emotion going around, especially in the first part of the week, but everyone has taken responsibility for the situation.\n\n\"We have lost some good men this season due to our performances, and we are all responsible for that.\"\n\nFor the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter.",

Nokia also briefly sold Android-based handsets - known as Nokia X - in 2014.\n\nMicrosoft used Nokia's brand for a short time after buying the company's mobile devices the same year, but later referred to the devices solely by their Lumia name.\n\nNokia once dominated the mobile phone market but struggled after the launch of the iPhone a decade ago, and the subsequent release of Google's Android operating system.\n\nHMD Global had previously indicated it would release several Nokia-branded Android phones in 2017.\n\nIt is expected to provide details of at least some of the other launches at another trade show - Barcelona's Mobile World Congress - in February.\n\n\"The decision by HMD to launch its first Android smartphone into China is a reflection of the desire to meet the real world needs of consumers in different markets around the world,\" the firm said in a statement.\n\n\"With over 552 million smartphone users in China in 2016, a figure that is predicted to grow to more than 593 million users by 2017, it is a strategically important market where premium design and quality is highly valued by consumers.\"\n\nHMD Gobal sells feature phones, including the Nokia 150, in other parts of the world\n\nThe Nokia 6 phone runs Android 7.0 - the latest version, also known as Nougat - and features:\n\nThe specifications are mid-range, and so is the price: 1,699 yuan ($245; \u00a3200).\n\nThat makes it slightly more expensive than Huawei's Honor 6X but cheaper than Xiaomi's Mi 5s.\n\n\"Nokia remains one of the most recognised mobile phone brands on the planet,\" commented Ben Wood from the CCS Insight technology consultancy.\n\n\"HMD Global will be hoping it can capitalise on this as it seeks to relaunch Nokia devices in 2017.\n\n\"It will be hoping the brand will help it stand out in the incredibly crowded Android smartphone market, which is characterised by cut-throat competition and a sea of design sameness. \"\n\nBrandon Ackroyd, Head of Customer Insight at Tiger Mobiles believes that Nokia will launch the Nokia 6 globally if the device has a successful launch in Asia.\n\n\"If the Nokia 6 performs well in China then it's highly likely we will see a new international variant of the handset sometime in 2017. We'll be keeping our eyes on the certification websites in the coming months looking for a variant with more connectivity options like GSM, LTE, and CDMA that will make the device compatible with networks worldwide.\"\n\nFollow all our CES coverage at bbc.co.uk/ces2017\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nThe Football Association plans to increase FA Cup prize money with the aim of helping lower league clubs, says chief executive Martin Glenn.\n\nIn October, the FA signed a six-season overseas broadcast rights deal for the FA Cup - reportedly worth \u00a3820m.\n\nGlenn said the FA could raise the current \u00a325m fund because of the deal, which starts from the 2018-19 season.\n\n\"The FA Cup is a great way of redistributing money to the lower leagues,\" Glenn told BBC Radio 5 live.\n\n\"The prize fund is \u00a325m,\" Glenn told Sportsweek. \"We're looking to increase that over the coming years and hopefully benefit the smaller clubs.\"\n\nGlenn also said the FA may look at introducing a \"unity\" payment which would help split money more equally. Under the current system, clubs receive a larger amount of money if their game is televised.\n\nSports minister Tracey Crouch warned last month that the government will legislate to force through FA reforms if the governing body does not make changes itself, setting a deadline of April for the FA to \"set a path to reform\".\n\nGlenn reiterated some of the concerns of five former FA executives, including previous chairman Greg Dyke, who said the organisation was held back by \"elderly white men\".\n\nFigures show that of the FA Council's 122 members, 92 are aged over 60, eight are women and four are from ethnic minority backgrounds.\n\n\"It's over-represented by white males who are quite old and it doesn't reflect the people actually in the game and that's the opportunity,\" said Glenn.\n\n\"With council reform, we'd like to see term limits and the government would like to see term limits so you can't stay there for life.\n\n\"You might do three sets of four years and then move on so fresh blood can come through.\"\n\nThe FA Cup third round saw many top-flight sides rotate their squad, with Bournemouth making 11 changes before they lost 3-0 away at League One side Millwall.\n\nBut Glenn said he is happy for teams to use the competition to juggle their resources.\n\n\"I think Bournemouth were an outlier. Eddie Howe can make his own reasons for it,\" he said.\n\n\"It doesn't upset me. The Premier League teams really understand the value the FA Cup brings them.\n\n\"People want to do well in the cup, but the positive side is that these bigger clubs have big squads, you want to give people game time.\n\n\"Giving a chance for young players to get real-game experience is not a bad thing.\"",

It suggests it can be readily tackled, by diverting the money set aside for foreign aid.\n\nEducation leaders are said by the Sunday Telegraph to be concerned about government plans to place student feedback at the heart of a new ranking system for universities.\n\nAcademics warn the measures could lead to institutions giving in to student demands, however unreasonable they may be.\n\nOne professor, Lady Woolf, describes the new approach as a \"direct threat to academic standards\".\n\nThe Department for Education insists it is critical to ensuring young people can access high-quality teaching.\n\nWith the headline \"Jail Tinmates\", the Sunday Mirror reveals that tinned tuna has been placed on the list of prison contraband.\n\nPrison inspectors have found that inmates are getting friends to smuggle in the canned goods because of the poor quality of food in jail.\n\nIt says Muslim prisoners are having to supplement their diet because of a failure to prepare halal foods separately.\n\nAnd the Sun on Sunday carries a \"world exclusive\" interview with a man from Gloucester - who is four months pregnant.\n\nHayden, who was born a girl but is now legally male, says he has delayed his hormone treatment to have a baby using donor sperm.",

            "content": "Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney says he is \"honoured\" to be level with Sir Bobby Charlton as the club's all-time leading goalscorer - but wants to break the record soon.\n\nHis FA Cup strike against Reading took Rooney, 31, to 249 goals in 543 games, reaching the landmark 215 matches and four seasons quicker than Charlton.\n\n\"It's a proud moment,\" he said.\n\n\"We've got two home games coming up this week so hopefully I can get the next one in one of those.\"\n\nUnited play Hull City in the first leg of their League Cup semi-final on Tuesday (20:00 GMT kick-off), before taking on Liverpool in the Premier League at 16:00 on 15 January.\n\n\"This club is a huge part of my life and I'm honoured to be up there alongside Sir Bobby,\" said Rooney after Saturday's 4-0 win over the Royals at Old Trafford.\n\u2022 None Listen: Rooney was always going to break records - Moyes\n\n'He was always going to break records'\n\nUnited manager Jose Mourinho said: \"A more special day will arrive. It was great but I want one more goal. He is an amazing guy in the group and we all want him to do it. To have Wayne as the top scorer in a club like this is magnificent for him.\"\n\nReading boss Jaap Stam, who played 127 times for United, added: \"Wayne has been a great player from the beginning. He is a player who works very hard for the team and you could see that in the game. With the quality he has as an individual and the quality players he is playing with, it makes him an outstanding player.\n\n\"It is not surprising he has scored this many goals. Even when they are 4-0 up, he is still sprinting and running for the ball.\"\n\nIn 2015, Rooney surpassed World Cup winner Charlton's England scoring record of 49 goals and has since taken his international tally to 53.\n\nThe United landmark comes during a season in which the England captain has been left out of the starting line-up for both club and country, his record-equalling goal being just his fourth of the campaign.\n\nFormer United manager David Moyes, now at Sunderland, added: \"First of all it's congratulations. To even get mentioned in the same breath as Sir Bobby Charlton, who for so many people is a great for what he did with England and Manchester United, is an achievement.\n\n\"You have to give Wayne Rooney credit for the limelight he has had to work under and the pressure people continually put on him.\n\n\"He has had a great career. It comes to an end at some time in football and sometimes you drop off a little bit but Wayne was always going to break the records in my eyes. The times I have worked with him he was always very good. A great player, a great trainer and someone who always wanted to go about his business well.\"\n\nHow has Rooney done it?\n\nThe signs were there from the very start that Rooney's could be a stellar Old Trafford career.\n\nIn his first game following a \u00a327m move from Everton in 2004, he scored a hat-trick against Fenerbahce in a 6-2 Champions League win.\n\nHe has not looked back since, reaching double figures in every season at the club, including a career-high 34 in all competitions in 2009-10 and 2011-12.\n\nRooney and Charlton are ahead of some of the finest players that Manchester United and British football has known.\n\nCharlton, who came up through the United youth system, spent 17 years at Old Trafford before finishing his career with spells at Preston and Irish side Waterford United.\n\nAnd despite his consistency over such a long period, he never managed to hit the 30-goal mark in a single season, coming closest when he struck 29 times during his third season at Old Trafford.\n\nDespite Rooney's scoring bursts, his goals have not come at the fastest rate. Tommy Taylor, who was a two-time title winner with United in the 1950s, holds that honour, just ahead of former Netherlands international Ruud van Nistelrooy.\n\nRooney's ratio of 0.459 goals per game puts him eighth on the list, while Charlton (0.328) does not even make the top 10.\n\nWhere does Rooney rank in list of Man Utd greats?\n\nRooney has secured his place in Manchester United history and Old Trafford's hall of greats with his record-equalling goalscoring feats.\n\nHowever, he will have to resign himself to never being held in the same esteem, and place of legend, as the likes of Charlton, George Best and Denis Law.\n\nIndeed, despite his lofty place in United's record books, the 31-year-old will never be revered by United's supporters in the same manner as the maverick Old Trafford catalyst Eric Cantona, the great leaders Roy Keane and Bryan Robson, and brilliant home-grown products such as Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville.\n\nThis may seem brutally unfair given his contribution to United's successes, but there are several factors at work when his place in the club's historical affections is measured.\n\nRooney was an expensive import from Merseyside, while Charlton, who survived the 1958 Munich air disaster, led United to their first European Cup in 1968 and stands alongside his great mentor Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson as an iconic Old Trafford figure.\n\nBest and Law came alongside Charlton as United's 'Holy Trinity' as the club emerged from the tragedy of Munich, while Cantona was the great transformer in the early 90s and the likes of Robson and Keane were world-class players and warriors.\n\nRooney's chequered history with the club and its fans will also have an impact on his legacy when his contribution to United - a truly great one when judged solely in a football context - is reflected upon.\n\nIn many eyes, Rooney will never quite be forgiven for the episode in October 2010 when he decided he wanted to leave, then further strained his relationship with club and fans by issuing a statement which effectively said United lacked ambition and questioned the quality of his team-mates.\n\nThis was resolved within days when he signed a new five-year-contract, but the memory has lingered for many. There was another disagreement late in the 2012-13 season as Ferguson prepared for retirement and made it clear Rooney again wanted to leave - a claim that led to the player being jeered by some fans as he collected his title winner's medal at Old Trafford.\n\nFans and those who record history and legends take these matters into account.\n\nWhat must also be remembered is that Rooney has had a stellar United career littered with trophies, brilliance and game-changing moments. He fully deserves to be remembered as one of the greats of Old Trafford.\n\nThere will, however, be many more remembered before him.",

            "section": "Asia",
            "content": "Set in an animated Manila, 'Saving Sally' has been billed as a teenage love story\n\nIt's a tale of unrequited teenage love terrorised by giant animated monsters in the chaotic streets of Metro Manila.\n\nSaving Sally tells the story of Marty, a young aspiring Philippines comic book artist, played by Enzo Marcos.\n\nHe falls in love with his best friend Sally, a gadget inventor - portrayed by Filipina actress Rhian Ramos - who is also the centre of Marty's universe.\n\nThe story quickly unfolds with stunning cartoons which tell the story of Marty's lonely world.\n\nLike every love story, there are numerous complications and challenges for the hero.\n\nNamely defending the love of his life from a beastly rival and her difficult parents, who take the form of monsters because to Marty, that is simply what they are.\n\n\"Sadly, Marty also has the innate ability to do nothing about everything despite his vivid fantasies of defending Sally from the big bad world,\" described the film's director Avid Liongoren.\n\nMarty often dreams of defending Sally from the evils of her world\n\nWhile it has been described as a \"typical teen movie about love, monsters and gadgets\", the film also touches on serious issues prevalent in Philippine society.\n\n\"On the surface, it's a fun and straightforward love story, with good laughs and visual gags that reference Filipino as well as Western pop culture,\" said screenwriter Charlene Sawit-Esguerra , who wrote and conceptualised the film.\n\n\"But it also touches on darker themes like physical abuse and escapism.\"\n\nSaving Sally's darker themes are mixed in with the teenage love story\n\nAfter an arduous 10-year journey and a series of setbacks, the team's efforts paid off. Saving Sally gained an entry into the 2016 Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF).\n\nThe annual festival serves as an outlet to better promote local talent in the Pinoy film industry. But the MMFF sadly still could not save Sally.\n\nThe humble film was not widely shown in local cinemas.\n\nThe Philippine skyline takes centre stage in this film, which features stunning artwork\n\nIts creators said the answer could lie in the nature of the domestic cinema industry.\n\nLargely unregulated, Philippine cinemas have built a notorious reputation for favouring commercial successes movies like Hollywood blockbusters and \"manufactured\" romance dramas.\n\n\"They pick the films that they think people will watch. So it is more of a perception that since ours is a small, non-studio film, no-one would want to watch it,\" explained Mr Liongoren.\n\nMs Sawit-Esguerra said \"demand\" was often a deciding factor before a film could be considered for screening.\n\n\"Theatre owners here think that local audiences will only watch films starring big-names and A-list stars, produced by major studios. Saving Sally has neither,\" she said.\n\n\"Because of this, many cinemas don't want to take the risk and would rather see how audiences responds to our movie first.\"\n\nSaving Sally earned a festival entry but was not widely screened in cinemas\n\nTo film critic Oggs Cruz, another problem with the film lay in its animation, the very thing that its makers fought so hard to create.\n\n\"While most Filipinos enjoy animated films, the animated aspect in Saving Sally doesn't favour its commercial ability,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"It is an adjunct of the main characters and I don't think it has any effect in its marketability. Sadly it won't entice children or adults.\"\n\n\"A lot of Filipinos are proud of their heritage but ironically, they would rather watch the latest Star Wars movie than support local film festival entries.\n\n\"It's a losing situation for the film makers whose work will get pulled out for more commercially viable movies that will earn more money.\"\n\nThe show's creators turned to the power of social media and launched an online campaign to save Sally, calling on audiences to contact theatre owners demanding they screen the film.\n\n\"Let your voices be heard. Please help us make noise and reach out,\" read a Facebook post on the movie's official page which drew close to 50,000 reactions and was shared more than 10,000 times.\n\nThousands of curious Facebook users and fans began to show their support for the film by leaving comments and writing posts using the hashtags #ShowSavingSally and #ImSavingSally.\n\n\"It was worth the wait and our money. Great storytelling and amazing animation - good job,\" gushed Dicay Galvez from Makati city who shared his joy in finally being able to catch the film.\n\n\"I cannot imagine the love and passion that went into this film, it may be a typical love story but the entirety of the movie itself is a work of art,\" wrote Ace Antipolo in an Instagram post.\n\n\"Big movie companies in the Philippines just don't put this kind of effort anymore but the efforts of a small group of people who worked for 10 years just to complete this beautiful masterpiece will be cherished forever.\"\n\n\"I guess business is business but I just don't understand why some cinemas saved spots for other movies over Saving Sally. Please show it in Bacolod,\" said Fraire Acupan.\n\nGiven its animation-meets-real life component which plays out heavily, and its slacker hero, Saving Sally has drawn comparisons with popular 2010 geek sleeper hit Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.\n\nBut will Sally see a similar indie cult following to that which Scott Pilgrim enjoyed?\n\nIts makers said the public response \"has been incredible\" and fan demand played a crucial role in boosting the film.\n\nSaving Sally was shown on around 50 screens to begin with, but was expected to close at 86 screens.\n\n\"Theatres have relented to the barrage of messages from Filipino youngsters wanting to see our film,\" said Mr Liongoren.\n\nMs Sawit-Esguerra said: \"Saving Sally surpassed what it was expected to earn, according to Industry experts. It also made it to the top four of the festival films based on how it did at the Philippine box office.\"\n\nShe also added that they have received offers for a North American release but that has not yet been finalised.\n\n\"We've also been invited to film festivals in Portugal, Spain and Belgium,\" she said.",

But drone pilots commute to work - and to war - each day. Vin Ray was given rare access to the only US Air Force base devoted entirely to flying drones, where he discovered the pilots' strange double life.\n\nIf you're a drone pilot, there's a strong possibility you live in Las Vegas. And your commute to work is against the traffic.\n\nWe were told to drive northwest out of the city on US Route 95. The road stretches out through the barren, inhospitable scrub of the Nevada desert.\n\nPay attention, we were told, because the signpost is small. In fact, it's very small. But we eventually arrived at our destination: Creech US Air Force Base, a small, flat, city in the desert. And the only air base devoted to flying drones.\n\nInside the base, comparisons with science fiction are hard to avoid. A drone looks like a conflation of a giant insect and a light aircraft. It's unmanned.\n\nStanding by a runway, we watch a drone land and pass right in front of us.\n\nThe camera underneath its chin, swivels quickly sideways and looks right at us - someone, somewhere on the base, is watching us.\n\nI'm escorted through a non-descript door in the side of what looks like a beige metal shipping container. It's cramped inside. At the far end there's a pilot seated on the left, who flies the drone and fires the missiles.\n\nThe sensor operator sits on the right - they operate the camera and fix the laser on the target for the missile to hit. They're focused on a bank of screens, switches and buttons. This is today's kind of cockpit. But it doesn't feel like a battleground.\n\nFor a start, there's a sensory deficiency. From my experience on the ground, you can taste war - you can smell it and you can certainly hear it. In here there's a just a mute video.\n\nBut that's not the only difference.\n\nTraditionally, soldiers in a war zone are based together. They have each others' camaraderie, and they're separated from their families.\n\nBut it's not the same if you're commuting to work every day.\n\nObviously, the drive itself is simple. But the psychological journey is altogether different. Imagine. Between six in the evening and six in the morning you might collect your kids from school, pick up some groceries on the way home and help make dinner.\n\nBut between 6am and 6pm you have a licence to kill.\n\nThis commute is familiar to Lt Col Matt Martin. He's a hugely experienced former drone pilot. He exudes a quiet strength and a ready charm.\n\nBut he talks about his schizophrenic existence, his inability to have a normal life and the strain it took on his family.\n\n\"It's a surreal enterprise,\" he says. \"You only have the drive to work and then you're flying. So for me, I would take that drive to switch gears. I would step into my cockpit and be totally immersed in flying the drone. Then a few hours later I would step out and be back in Las Vegas, in a totally different time zone, different time of day.\"\n\nHere's what the base commander Col Case Cunningham told me: \"When they walk through the gate, they're in a war. Although physically they are at home, mentally they're at war. So in effect we're asking them to redeploy every single day, to go back home and be parents and be loved ones - and then come back to war again\".\n\nSuch are the new frontiers of the modern battlefield.\n\nThese drone pilots can sit in Nevada and watch a potential target 8,000 miles (12,000km) away for months on end, building up what they call \"patterns of life\" - building what's been called a \"remote intimacy\" with their prey - all in the knowledge that, one day, they may kill them.\n\nA conventional fighter pilot will fire missiles and then head back to base. But drone pilots are required to circle for some hours afterwards, to assess the damage. The picture they're looking at is extraordinarily clear - and the damage is often in the form of body parts.\n\nSmall wonder that Creech now employs a psychologist for drone pilots suffering stress. Drones are globalising the battlefield, blurring the boundaries between war and home.\n\nAs we get ready to leave the base, the moon rises over the mountains and darkness falls quickly. There's a long traffic jam as some of the 3,500 air staff wait at the gates to leave the base - a snake of red tail lights heading back to Vegas and the warmth of their families.\n\nAnd when they get home? Well, friction can stem from one simple question: \"How was your day?\"\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.",
