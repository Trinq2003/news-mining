            "description": "When two Iraqi men fell in love during intense fighting in the city of Ramadi in 2003, it was the beginning of a long, long struggle to live together as a couple.",
            "section": "Magazine",
            "content": "US Army interpreter Nayyef Hrebid and Iraqi soldier Btoo Allami fell in love at the height of the Iraq War. It was the start of a dangerous 12-year struggle to live together as a couple.\n\nIn 2003, Nayyef Hrebid found himself in the midst of the Iraq war. The fine art graduate had signed up to be a translator for the US Army after he couldn't find a job.\n\n\"I was based in Ramadi, which was the worst place at that time. We would go out on patrols and people would be killed by IEDs [roadside bombs] and snipers. I was asking myself: 'Why am I here? Why am I doing this?'\"\n\nHowever, a chance encounter with a soldier in the Iraqi army changed everything.\n\n\"One day I was sitting outside and this guy came out of the shower block. I saw his hair was shiny and very black and he was smiling. I just thought, 'Oh my god, this guy is really cute.'\n\n\"I felt like something beautiful had happened in this very bad place.\"\n\nHrebid was secretly gay. He hadn't come out because same-sex relationships are taboo in Iraq and gay people are at risk of violent attacks.\n\n\"In Iraq being gay is seen as very wrong and brings shame on your family. You can even get killed for it so you have to be very careful,\" he says.\n\nHrebid worked as a translator for the US army\n\nWhat Hrebid didn't realise was that the soldier, Btoo Allami, was also attracted to him.\n\n\"I had this strange feeling like I had been looking for him. My feelings grew over time and I knew I wanted to talk to him,\" Allami says.\n\nThey had a chance to get to know each other when they took part in a mission to clear insurgents from the city's general hospital.\n\n\"After patrols we would come back to the safe house and one day Btoo invited me over to eat food and talk with him and the other soldiers,\" Hrebid says.\n\n\"We talked night after night and my feelings for him grew. \"\n\nThree days after the dinner, Hrebid and Allami found an excuse to go outside to talk on their own. They sat in a dark parking lot, full of US Humvees.\n\n\"I felt very close to Nayyef and I felt it was time for me to say something,\" Allami says.\n\n\"So I told him about my feelings and that I loved him. And then he kissed me and left. It was an amazing night. I didn't eat for two days afterwards.\"\n\nBtoo, pictured by a Humvee, was a sergeant in the Iraqi army\n\nThe relationship swiftly developed and they spent an increasing amount of time together at the camp.\n\n\"On missions I'd try to be close to him, when I should have been with the Americans. We would walk together and we took some pictures together,\" Hrebid says.\n\nTheir American and Iraqi colleagues soon noticed.\n\n\"I was telling my American captain about Btoo and he helped bring him over to stay with me at the American camp for a few nights,\" says Hrebid.\n\n\"But some of the other soldiers stopped talking to me after they found out I was gay. One of my translator friends from my home city ended up hitting me with a big stick, which broke my arm.\"\n\nIn 2007, Hrebid and Allami were both deployed to Diwaniyah in southern Iraq. They were lucky to be in the same city but still had to keep their relationship secret. But in 2009, Hrebid applied for asylum in America, as his long involvement with the US Army made it too dangerous to stay.\n\n\"I thought I could go and then it would be easy to apply for Btoo to come afterwards,\" Hrebid says.\n\n\"I knew if we stayed in Iraq we had no future. We were going to end up married to women and hiding our whole lives. But I had watched the TV series Queer As Folk and I realised there were gay communities on the other side of the world.\"\n\nHrebid was granted asylum and settled in Seattle. However, his attempts to get a visa for Allami to join him were unsuccessful. Meanwhile, Allami's family had discovered he was gay and started putting pressure on him to marry a woman. With help from Hrebid's friend Michael Failla, a refugee activist, he escaped to Beirut.\n\n\"It wasn't an easy decision to make as I had a 25-year contract with the army,\" Allami says.\n\n\"Plus I was the only one supporting my family. But I knew I had to be with Nayyef.\"\n\nAllami (left) and Hrebid knew they couldn't live openly as a gay couple in Iraq\n\nAllami applied to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for resettlement but his tourist visa ran out before they resolved his case. As an illegal immigrant he had to steer clear of soldiers and checkpoints to avoid being sent back to Iraq.\n\n\"The waiting was hard,\" says Allami.\n\n\"I felt like I was stuck and not moving forward. But then I would speak to Nayyef and that always made me feel stronger.\"\n\nThey talked to each other on Skype every day.\n\n\"He would watch me cook breakfast and I would watch him cook dinner and we would talk as if we lived together,\" Hrebid says.\n\nAlthough homosexuality is legal in Iraq, activists say many gay men, and some women, have died in targeted killings\n\nIn 2012, a BBC World Service investigation found that law enforcement agencies had been involved in systematic persecution of homosexuals\n\nThe Islamic State group killed dozens of gay men between 2015 and 2016 - many were thrown to their deaths from high-rise buildings\n\nAllami was interviewed by the UNHCR several times, but his application was beset with problems and delays.\n\nAgain Michael Failla provided support, flying twice to Beirut to advocate on Allami's behalf.\n\n\"I call him my godfather,\" Allami says.\n\nBut while awaiting the UNHCR decision Allami got an interview at the Canadian Embassy in Lebanon. With Failla's help he was able to fly to Vancouver in September 2013.\n\nThe couple were now living just a tantalising 140 miles (225 km) apart across the border.\n\n\"I came across every weekend to see Btoo and any day I had off work,\" Hrebid says.\n\nThe couple got married in Canada in 2014 on Valentine's Day. Hrebid then applied for a US visa for Allami as his husband. In February 2015 they were invited for an interview with US immigration in Montreal.\n\n\"It was a long flight, six or seven hours, and it was freezing - like 27 below zero,\" says Hrebid.\n\n\"The officer asked us three or four questions and after about 10 minutes she told Btoo: 'You've been approved to live as an immigrant in the United States.'\n\n\"I had to ask her to repeat it again. I put my hand over my mouth to stop myself screaming. We went outside and I was just crying and shaking. I could not believe it was finally happening. We were going to live together in the place where we wanted to live.\"\n\nIn March 2015, Hrebid and Allami travelled from Vancouver to Seattle by bus. They decided to have another wedding ceremony in the US and tied the knot in Washington State.\n\n\"We did not celebrate the first one and we wanted to have a dream wedding,\" says Hrebid.\n\n\"It was the most happy day of my life.\"\n\nToday they live together in an apartment in Seattle. Hrebid, who now works as a home decor department manager is a US citizen. Allami has a green card and is due to become a citizen next year. He works as a building supervisor.\n\nTheir story has been turned in to a documentary called Out of Iraq, which premiered at the LA Film Festival last year.\n\n\"We do not have to hide. I can hold his hand when we walk down the street,\" Hrebid says.\n\nAllami agrees. \"It's so different for us now,\" he says.\n\n\"Before we were so hopeless but now we feel like a family. It's a gay-friendly city. I'm living the dream. I'm free.\"\n\nPictures courtesy of World of Wonder Productions\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.",

            "description": "Millions of women have no problem with the pill but some find it shatters their mental health. Here The Debrief's Vicky Spratt describes years of depression, anxiety and panic.",
            "section": "Magazine",
            "content": "Millions of women rely on the contraceptive pill and many are happy with it - but some find it has a devastating effect on their mental health. Here Vicky Spratt, deputy editor of The Debrief, describes years of depression, anxiety and panic as she tried one version of the pill after another.\n\nI sat in the GP's office with my mum and told her that I'd been having my period for three weeks. She told me that the contraceptive pill might help. She warned that it wouldn't protect me from sexually transmitted infections and told me that if I had unprotected sex I could get cervical cancer, so I'd best use it wisely. She had to say that, though I was 14 and sex was very much not on the agenda.\n\nMy prescription was printed in reception. And then, a three-month supply of the combined pill was mine. Picking up the green foil-covered packets full of tiny yellow pills felt like a rite of passage - I was a woman now. In the plastic pockets was the sugar-coated distillation of feminism, of women's liberation, of medical innovation.\n\nThis is where it all began, 14 years ago. I then played what I call pill roulette for more than a decade, trying different brands with varying degrees of success and disaster. It was around this time that I also developed anxiety, depression and serious mood swings which, on and off, have affected me throughout my adult life.\n\nRelationships have ended and I had to take a year out from university - I thought that was just \"who I was\", a person ill-equipped for life, lacking self-confidence and unhappy. It wouldn't be until my early 20s, after graduating from university - when my mental health problems and behaviour could no longer be dismissed as those of a \"moody teenager\" - that I would seriously question whether it was linked to my use of the pill.\n\nOne day in the early hours, sitting at my laptop, unable to sleep because of a panic attack which had lasted overnight, I began to Google. I had started taking a new pill, a progestogen-only pill (POP) which had been prescribed because I was suffering from migraines, and the combined pill is not safe for people who suffer from migraines with aura.\n\nI tapped the name of the pill + depression/anxiety into the search engine and the internet did the rest. There it was: forum threads and blog posts from people who were experiencing the same symptoms as me.\n\nAt this point I had already seen my GP several times, following the sudden onset of debilitating panic attacks, which I had never experienced before. At no point had my contraceptive pill come up in conversation, despite the fact that the attacks had started when I switched to the new contraceptive. Instead, I was prescribed a high dose of beta blockers, used to treat anxiety, and it was recommended that I should undergo cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\n\nI lived like this for somewhere between six and eight months - I can't tell you exactly because that year of my life is a blur, recorded by my mind in fast-forward because of the constant sense of urgency and impending doom that coursed through my veins.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe Debrief carried out an investigation, surveying 1,022 readers, aged 18-30\n\nI wish, wholeheartedly, that I could look back on this and laugh. That's how all good stories end, isn't it? But there was then, and is now, nothing funny about what I went through. It was terrifying. I was scared. I didn't recognise myself, I didn't like myself and I couldn't live my life. I didn't know what to do, who to turn to or whether it would ever end. I was not only anxious but lethargic, I felt completely useless. I blamed myself.\n\nAt the time, convinced that I had lost my mind and feeling as though I was having an out-of-body experience, I explained to my GP that \"I felt like someone else\", as though my brain \"had gone off and gone mouldy\".\n\n\"Do you think this could have anything to do with my new pill?\" I asked. I remember the look on her face, an attempt to look blank which barely concealed a desire to tell me I was ridiculous. I explained to her that I had felt awful on every single one of the six or seven pills I'd taken up until that point, with the exception of one high-oestrogen combined pill which made me feel like superwoman for a year, before it was taken away from me (partly because of the migraines and partly because of an increased risk of thrombosis with continued use).\n\nShe told me, categorically, that my new pill was not the problem.\n\nBut, disobeying both her and my therapist, I stopped taking the progestogen-only pill.\n\nI can only describe what happened next as the gradual and creeping return of my sense of self. After three or four weeks I also stopped taking the beta blockers. To this day, I still carry them with me. They're in every handbag I own, a safety net should I fall off the enormous cliff of my own mind again. In three-and-a-half years I have never had to take them.\n\nMy problems didn't disappear overnight, of course, but I did stop having panic attacks. I haven't had one since. I feel low from time to time, anxious and stressed but it's nowhere near on the same scale as what I experienced while taking the progestogen-only pill. I felt joy again, my libido returned and I stopped feeling terrified of absolutely everything and everyone.\n\nA year after the panic attacks subsided I sat on a faraway beach, after taking a solo long-haul flight halfway round the world. This would have been unthinkable the previous year. As I sat there, underneath a tropical electrical storm, I cried with relief. Relief that I was myself again, relief that I had control of my own mind once more and relief that I hadn't been wrong, that I knew myself better than doctors had made me feel I did.\n\nNow 28, I no longer use hormonal contraception and with the exception of mild mood swings in the 48 hours before my period I am, touch wood, free of anxiety, depression and panic attacks.\n\nIn the years that have passed since I lost myself on the progestogen-only pill and found myself again on a South Asian beach, this issue has been gradually receiving more and more attention. Holly Grigg Spall's book, Sweetening The Pill, published in 2013, put the effects of hormonal contraception on women's mental health firmly on the agenda.\n\nSince then a study, overseen by Prof Ojvind Lidegaard at the University of Copenhagen, found that women taking the pill - either the combined pill or the progestogen-only pill - were more likely to be prescribed an antidepressant than those not on hormonal contraception. The difference was particularly noticeable for young women aged between 15 and 19 on the combined pill.\n\nLidegaard was able to conduct this research because he had access to medical records for more than a million Danish women aged 15-34.\n\nFollowing the publication of Prof Lidegaard's study I sent a freedom of information request to the NHS, in my capacity as a journalist at The Debrief. I knew, from the number of our readers who write to us on a near-daily basis about this issue, that significant numbers of women were suffering. I asked the NHS whether they knew how many women were taking antidepressants or beta blockers concurrently. They told me that their systems do not yet allow them to collect this data.\n\nProf Helen Stokes-Lampard, Chair of the Royal College of GPs, says: \"There is an established link between hormones and mood, both positive and negative, but for the vast majority of women, the benefits of reliable contraception and regulation of their menstrual cycle outweigh any side effects, and many women report that taking hormones actually boosts their mood.\n\n\"If a woman believes her contraception might be adversely affecting her mood, she should discuss it with a healthcare professional at her next routine appointment.\"\n\nSee also: How risky is the contraceptive pill?\n\nDepression is listed as a known but rare side effect of the hormonal contraceptive pill, it's there in the small but hefty leaflet you get in the packet. The NHS website lists \"mood swings\" and \"mood changes\" but not explicitly depression, anxiety or panic attacks.\n\nWe shouldn't throw our pill packets away but neither should we accept negative side effects which impinge on our day-to-day lives. We can't make informed choices without information. We need better research into how hormonal contraception can affect women's mental health, better ways of monitoring reactions in patients, more awareness and support for those who do experience serious side effects. No woman should feel dismissed or ignored.\n\nVicky Spratt is deputy editor of The Debrief, a website for women in their 20s.

            "section": "US & Canada",
            "content": "Barack Obama sealed his racial legacy the moment he sealed victory in the 2008 election - a black man would occupy a White House built by slaves, a history-defying as well as history-making achievement.\n\nIn 1961, the year of Obama's birth, there existed in the American South a system of racial apartheid that separated the races from the cradle to the grave.\n\nIn some states, his very conception - involving an African father from Kenya and a white mother from Kansas - would have been a criminal offence.\n\nWhen in the 1950s, a former TV executive by the name of E Frederic Morrow became the first black White House aide not to have a job description that included turning down beds, polishing shoes or serving drinks with a deferential bow, he was prohibited from ever being alone in the same room as a white woman.\n\nBack then, as Morrow recounted in his memoir, Black Man in the White House, African-Americans were routinely stereotyped as sexual predators incapable of controlling their desires.\n\nLittle more than half a century later, a black man ran the White House - occupying the Oval Office, sitting at the head of the conference table in the Situation Room, relaxing with his beautiful young family in the Executive Mansion - a family that has brought such grace and glamour to America's sleepy capital that it is possible to speak of a Black Camelot.\n\nPresident and first lady on the first day of his presidency\n\nWhen Jack and Jackie Kennedy lived in the White House, that would have been unthinkable, even though the civil rights movement was starting to hammer more insistently at the walls of prejudice, and seeking legal and legislative redress for a malignant national condition described as the \"American dilemma\".\n\nWhen demonstrators assembled in August 1963 to hear Martin Luther King deliver his I Have a Dream Speech at the Lincoln Memorial, few would have thought that a black man would one day take the oath of office at the other end of the National Mall.\n\nLikewise, how many of the protesters bludgeoned by white policemen on Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma in 1965 would have dared to imagine that, 50 years later, they would cross that same bridge hand in hand with the country's first black president?\n\nFor veterans of the black struggle, those remarkable images of Obama marking the 50th anniversary of the Selma protest became instantly iconographic, a truly golden jubilee.\n\nIn legacy terms, his very presence in the White House is one of the great intangibles of his presidency. Just how many black Americans have been encouraged to surmount colour bars of their own? Just how many young African-Americans have altered the trajectory of their lives because of the example set by Obama?\n\nAnd behaviourally, what an example it has been. Because of the lingering racism in American society, the Obamas doubtless knew they would have to reach a higher standard, and they have done so, seemingly, without breaking a sweat. In deportment and personal conduct, it is hard to recall a more impressive or well-rounded First Family.\n\nThe \"when they go low, we go high\" approach to racists who questioned his citizenship has made the Obamas look even more classy.\n\nHis family's dignity in the face of such ugliness recalls the poise of black sit-in protesters in the early 60s, who refused to relinquish their seats at segregated restaurants and lunch counters even as white thugs poured sugar and ketchup over their heads, and punched, kicked and spat at them.\n\nYet racial firsts, of the kind achieved by Barack Hussein Obama, can present a distorted view of history and convey a misleading sense of progress. They are, by their very nature, a singular achievement, a milestone indicative of black advance rather than a destination point.\n\nHollywood did not become colourblind the moment in 1964 that Sidney Poitier became the first black man to win best actor at the Academy Awards any more than discrimination ended in the justice system when Thurgood Marshall first donned the billowing robes of a Supreme Court jurist.\n\nYears after Poitier's win, black acting success at the Oscars continued to elude many\n\nAmerica's racial problems have not melted away merely because Obama has spent eight years in the White House. Far from it.\n\nIndeed, the insurmountable problem for Obama was that he reached the mountaintop on day one of his presidency.\n\nAchieving anything on the racial front that surpassed becoming the country's first black president was always going to be daunting. Compounding that problem were the unrealistically high expectations surrounding his presidency.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Barack Obama: What would he have done differently?\n\nHis election triumph is 2008 was also misinterpreted as an act of national atonement for the original sin of slavery and the stain of segregation.\n\nYet Obama did not win the election because he was a black man. It was primarily because a country facing an economic crisis and embroiled in two unpopular wars was crying out for change.\n\nDoubtless there have been substantive reforms. His two black attorneys general, Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, have revitalised the work of the justice department's civil rights division, which was dormant during the Bush years.\n\nThe Affordable Healthcare Act, or Obamacare, as it was inevitably dubbed, cut the black uninsured rate by a third.\n\nPartly in a bid to reverse the rate of black incarceration, he has commuted the sentences of hundreds of prisoners - 10 times the number of his five predecessors added together.\n\nAs well as calling for the closure of private prisons, he became the first president to visit a federal penitentiary. \"There but for the grace of God,\" said a man who had smoked pot and dabbled with cocaine in his youth.\n\nJanitor Fred Thomas shows off his Obama subway fare card in Washington in 2009\n\nEarly on, he used the bully pulpit of the presidency to assail black absentee fathers, and, more latterly, spoke out against police brutality. But that record of accomplishment looks rather meagre when compared to the drama of hearing \"Hail to the Chief\" accompany the arrival of a black man on the presidential stage.\n\nRace relations have arguably become more polarised and tenser since 20 January 2009. Though smaller in scale and scope, the demonstrations sparked by police shootings of unarmed black men were reminiscent of the turbulence of the 1960s.\n\nThe toxic cloud from the tear gas unleashed in Ferguson and elsewhere cast a long and sometimes overwhelming shadow. Not since the LA riots in 1992 - the violent response to the beating of Rodney King and the later acquittal of the police officers filmed assaulting him - has the sense of black grievance and outrage been so raw.\n\nHistorians will surely be struck by what looks like an anomaly, that the Obama years gave rise to a movement called Black Lives Matter.\n\nPublic opinion surveys highlight this racial restlessness. Not long after he took office in 2009, a New York Times/CBS News poll suggested two-thirds of Americans regarded race relations as generally good. In the midst of last summer's racial turbulence, that poll found there had been a complete reversal. Now 69% of Americans assessed race relations to be mostly bad.\n\nAn oft-heard criticism of Obama is that he has failed to bring his great rhetorical skills to bear on the American dilemma, and prioritised the LGBT community's campaign for equality at the expense of the ongoing black struggle.\n\nBut while he was happy to cloak himself in the mantle of America's first black president, he did not set out to pursue a black presidency. He did not want his years in office to be defined by his skin colour.\n\nThe impact of Obama's presence in the White House on a black generation is impossible to calculate\n\nAs a candidate, he often left others to attach racial meaning to his candidacy, rather than doing so himself.\n\nHis famed race speech in the 2008 primary campaign, when his friendship with a fiery black preacher threatened to derail his candidacy, was as much about his white heritage as his black.\n\nThis remained true when he won election. Besides, there were pressing problems to deal with, not least rescuing the American economy in the midst of the Great Recession and extricating US forces from two long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nEarly on in his presidency, his efforts at racial mediation also seemed ham-fisted. The \"beer summit\" at the White House, when he brought together the black Harvard academic Henry Louis Gates and the white police officer who had arrested him on the porch of his own home in an affluent suburb of Boston, all seemed rather facile.\n\nA clumsy photo-opportunity rather than a teachable moment. Obama, one sensed, wanted to speak out more forcefully - initially he said the Cambridge police \"acted stupidly\" - but his political cautiousness reined him in.\n\nSeemingly, he did not want to come across to the public as a black man in the White House.\n\nRather in those early years, it was as if he was trying to position himself as a neutral arbiter in racial matters, though one sensed his preference was for not intervening at all.\n\nAs his presidency went on, however, it became more emphatically black. He spoke out more passionately and more intimately.\n\nTelling reporters that his son would have looked like Trayvon Martin, the unarmed high school student shot dead in Florida by a neighbourhood watch coordinator, was a departure.\n\nThis new, more candid approach culminated in Charleston, South Carolina, when Obama delivered the eulogy at the funeral of Reverend Clementa Pinckney, the black preacher slain, along with eight other worshippers, by a white supremacist at a bible study class at the Emanuel American Methodist Episcopal church.\n\nThat afternoon he spoke, as he often does in front of mainly black audiences, with a cadence that almost ventriloquised the Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr, and ended, electrifyingly, by singing Amazing Grace.\n\nThe acquittal of Martin's killer led to the creation of Black Lives Matter\n\nThat month he seemed to be at the height of his powers.\n\nThe Confederate flag, a symbol for many of black subordination, was about to brought down in the grounds of the South Carolina State Capitol because the Charleston gunman Dylann Roof had brandished it so provocatively.\n\nObamacare had withstood a Supreme Court challenge. On the morning that he flew to Charleston, the Supreme Court decreed same-sex marriage would be legal in every state. Progressivism seemed to have triumphed. Obama seemed to have vanquished many of his foes.\n\nBut that month Donald Trump had also announced his improbable bid for the White House, and the forces of conservatism were starting to rally behind an outspoken new figurehead, who sensed that nativism, xenophobia and fear of the other would be central to his electoral appeal.\n\nThat America's first black president will be followed by the untitled leader of the Birther movement, a candidate slow to disavow support from the Ku Klux Klan and happy to receive the backing of white nationalists, Donald Trump can easily be portrayed as a personal repudiation and also proof of racial regression.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe truth, though, is more complicated.\n\nObama is ending his presidency with some of his highest personal approval ratings, and clearly believes he would have beaten Trump in a head-to-head contest. Moreover, although Trump won decisively in the electoral college, almost three million people more voted for Hillary Clinton nationwide.\n\nIn judging the mood of the country, the 2016 election hardly produced a clear-cut result that lends itself to neat analysis.\n\nWhat Trump's election does look to have done, however, is end Obama's hopes of being a transformative president, not least because of the proposed rollback of his signature healthcare reform.\n\nTruly transformative presidents, like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, enact reforms, like social security, that become part of the nation's fabric rather than being ripped apart. If Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress get their way, Obamacare will be shredded.\n\nNor has he been transformative in the attitudinal sense. Indeed, Trump's victory, messy though it was, can easily be viewed partly as a \"whitelash\".\n\nMuch of his earliest and strongest support came from so-called white nationalists, who saw in his candidacy the chance to reassert white cultural and racial dominance. Some of the loudest cheers at his rallies came in response his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim invectives.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Millennials worry about what's in store for the next generation of black Americans\n\nTrump's message, from the moment he announced his candidacy to the final tweets of his insurgent campaign, was aimed primarily at white America.\n\nThe billionaire's victory also makes it harder to view Obama as a transitional president. Eight years ago, it was tempting to cast the country's first black president as the leader who would oversee a peaceable demographic shift from a still strongly Caucasian America - the last census showed that 62.6% of US citizens are white - to a more ethnically diffuse nation.\n\nBut the talk now is of walls, not human bridges.\n\nOf course, the notion that Obama would usher in a post-racial America was always fanciful, and a claim wisely he steered clear of himself. For all his cries of \"Yes we can,\" he was never that na\u00efve.\n\nA young visitor to the Oval Office asks Obama if his hair feels like his, in 2009\n\nBut the black writer Ta-Nehisi Coates makes a persuasive case that Obama has always been overly optimistic on race, in large part because he did not have a conventional black upbringing.\n\nHis formative years were spent in Hawaii, America's most racially integrated state, and the whites he encountered, namely his mother and grandparents, were doting and loving.\n\nObama was not the victim of discrimination in the same way as a black kid growing up in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, or even New York or Illinois. As a result, he may have underestimated the forces that would seek to paralyse his presidency and to impede racial advance more broadly.\n\nThe president has said repeatedly since election night that the result proves that history is not linear but rather takes a zig-zagging course.\n\nCaught in the act, asleep in the White House\n\nHe is also fond of paraphrasing Martin Luther King's famed line that the arc of history bends towards justice. However, that curvature has veered off in a wholly unexpected direction.\n\nBesides, even to talk of arcs of history at this moment of such national uncertainty seems inapt.\n\nFor as we enter the final days of the Obama presidency, the more accurate descriptor of race relations is a fault-line - the most angry fault-line in US politics and American life, and one that continues to rumble away, threatening small explosions at any time.\n\nFrom Obama we expected seismic change of a more positive kind.\n\nAnd although it was a presidency that began atop a mountain, it ended in something of a valley.",

            "section": "US & Canada",
            "content": "It's almost time to close the book on Barack Obama's eight years as president. Before he relocates to Washington's posh Kalorama neighbourhood, however, here's a take on what he tried to do - and how well he did it.\n\nAlthough there are letter grades attached to each section, these assessments are not a reflection of the wisdom of his actions, only in how well he was able to advance his agenda over the course of his presidency.\n\nWhile a liberal might give his environmental policy high marks, a conservative would likely flunk him. What can't be argued, however, is that he accomplished a considerable amount during his eight years.\n\nGoing unmeasured are a number of Mr Obama's intangible or indirect accomplishments.\n\nWhile the White House sported rainbow-colouring the night after gay marriage became legal nationwide, that was the result of a Supreme Court decision not presidential action. And while Mr Obama often spoke movingly about race relations in the US, particularly after the shooting at a black church in South Carolina, there was little in the way of policy elements accompanying his words.\n\nMr Obama does have an ample record to judge, however. Here's a look at eight key areas - along with consideration of their \"Trump-ability\" - how easy it will be for incoming president Donald Trump to undo what Mr Obama has accomplished.\n\nTell Anthony on Twitter @awzurcher how you would grade Barack Obama's presidency.\n\nComprehensive healthcare reform had been the Democratic Party's holy grail for decades, always seemingly just out of reach. Under Mr Obama, they finally claimed the prize.\n\nDue to an electoral setback in the Senate before the bill's final passage, however, the massive piece of legislation was a half-baked cake, making implementation a challenge. The federal healthcare insurance marketplace website, essentially unusable for months after launch, was a very visible, politically devastating mistake.\n\nTo the surprise of Democrats, many Republican-controlled states opted not to expand Medicaid healthcare coverage for the poor. More recently, insurance premiums for exchange-based policies will increase markedly in some US states - which will be a financial blow to less affluent Americans not covered by government subsidies.\n\nMuch of the law operated as intended, however. The percentage of Americans without insurance dropped from 15.7% in 2011 to to 9.1% in 2015. More than 8.8 million Americans have signed up for coverage through the federal exchange in the current enrolment period - a record high. Insurers can't deny individuals coverage for their pre-existing medical conditions, and there are no lifetime dollar caps on coverage.\n\nDespite its shortcomings, passage of the Affordable Care Act, in the words of Vice-President Joe Biden, was a big expletive-ing deal.\n\nTrump-ability: Republicans have been trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act from the moment Mr Obama signed it into law. Mr Trump regularly condemned the programme as a failure. Now, Republicans are setting the wheels in motion to tear up the reforms \"root and branch\", in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's words.\n\nRepublicans will be able to shred the programme even with their slim majority in the Senate thanks to presidential authority and legislative manoeuvres.\n\nEnacting a replacement plan, however, will be more difficult. At the moment, they seem determined to jump off the repeal bridge without figuring out exactly where they will land, but Mr Trump has cautioned his congressional colleagues to be careful with how they go about the task.\n\nMr Obama's administration helped negotiate the Paris climate agreement, in which the US joined 185 countries in pledging to cut greenhouse gas emissions. It enacted a host of new regulations governing pollution from coal-fired power plants and limiting coal mining and oil and gas drilling both on federal lands and in coastal waters. Mr Obama also used his executive authority to designate 548 million acres of territory as protected habitat - more than any prior president.\n\nThe past eight years weren't without missed opportunities, however. Early in his administration, when Democrats had large majorities in Congress, the House of Representatives passed a stringent cap-and-trade programme for controlling carbon emissions. The Senate focused on financial and healthcare reform first, however, and the Democratic majority was gone before they could take action.\n\nThat may be as close as Democrats come to any sort of comprehensive environmental legislation for a great many years.\n\nTrump-ability: US participation in the Paris accord is still uncertain given that the president-elect promised to abandon it. While the withdrawal procedure is supposed to take four years, Mr Trump's team is reportedly searching for ways to speed up the process.\n\nOther Obama-era executive accomplishments, however, will be more difficult to roll back. Proposed regulatory changes will require an extended approval process and are sure to face a flurry of lawsuits from environmental groups. Congress could speed things up, but Democrats in the Senate have enough votes to block their efforts if they stick together.\n\nMr Obama made completion of two major trade agreements - the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - the cornerstone of his second term in office.\n\nThe TPP is destined for the dustbin without even consideration by the US Congress, thanks to a coalition of opposition from Democratic left and the economic nationalists who are sweeping to power with Mr Trump.\n\nThe TTIP, which is still in negotiation and attempts to reduce trade barriers between the US and the EU, is being abandoned by politicians on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe Obama administration did successfully implement free trade agreements with Panama, Colombia and South Korea, but they are dwarfed by the size and scope of the now-doomed regional deals.\n\nTrump-ability: Mr Trump can and will give a death blow to any hopes Mr Obama may have had of cementing a lasting trade legacy through the TPP and TTIP. More than that, the new president is poised to roll back the trade legacies of previous presidents, as he's pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement - which was concluded under President Bill Clinton - or perhaps even withdraw from the deal entirely.\n\nHis promises to enact draconian import tariffs on some foreign goods would also run counter to US commitments to the World Trade Organization, which could undermine the entire foundation of the current global trade regime.\n\nWhen Mr Obama took office, the US economy was in freefall. Unemployment had spiked to double digits, housing prices had collapsed and the financial industry teetered on the brink of collapse.\n\nThe picture eight years later is one of stability and modest growth, although critics will argue that things could be better (and blue-collar Trump voters in the industrial states seemed to agree).\n\nPolicy-wise, Mr Obama pushed through a major stimulus package and financial reform legislation early in his first term. His administration oversaw a support structure that saved General Motors from a bankruptcy that would have devastated the US auto industry.\n\nThe Home Affordable Refinance Program, run by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, allowed several million US homeowners to avoid foreclosure and refinance high-interest mortgages.\n\nThe president negotiated an agreement that rolled back many of the George W Bush era tax cuts in exchange for across-the-board spending freezes. He frequently called for a raise in the federal minimum wage, but he was unable to generate any support for such actions in the Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nAlthough the stock market is reaching new highs, 2015 household income is still below what it was in 2007. Considering where his presidency started, however, the current state of economic health is perhaps the president's most noteworthy legacy.\n\nTrump-ability: Republicans cutting taxes when they hold power is as certain as the sun rising in the east. Tax-reform, which will likely include a return to Bush-era rates along with even more substantive changes, appear all but certain for passage. Mr Obama's financial reform legislation also could be poised for weakening, as it was frequently the target of Mr Trump's anti-regulation ire.\n\nAlthough conservatives liked to criticise Mr Obama's efforts to bolster US companies as \"picking winners and losers\", early evidence (Carrier, Ford Motors, etc) indicates that's one tradition Mr Trump appears likely to continue, albeit with a sharper edge for businesses that don't comply to his wishes.\n\nMr Obama will leave the White House with two prominent feathers in his foreign policy cap - the Iran nuclear deal and normalised relations with Cuba. Say what you will about the merits of the accomplishments (and many have), they represent a notable thawing in relations between the US and two long-time antagonists.\n\nHe also oversaw the drawdown of US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan - fulfilling a key campaign promise.\n\nElsewhere, however, the president's international policy has been characterised by strained relations and festering problems. His planned \"reset\" of US-Russian relations upon taking office was followed by the nation's Ukrainian intervention and allegations of meddling in the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nThe Arab Spring uprisings that began in 2010 spread unrest throughout the Middle East, culminating in a Syrian Civil War that facilitated the rise of the so-called Islamic State and a devastating refugee crisis that has roiled European politics.\n\nNorth Korea continues to develop its nuclear weapons programme seemingly undeterred, and Mr Obama's plans for an \"Asian pivot\" in US foreign policy have done little to keep Chinese regional ambitions in check.\n\nResponsibility for this global unrest can't all be laid at Mr Obama's feet, of course, but it's a mark on his permanent record nonetheless.\n\nTrump-ability: Mr Trump has criticised the Iranian nuclear deal, although unlike some other Republicans he hasn't vowed to abandon it entirely. He may find renegotiating the multi-party agreement more difficult than he might think. As for Cuba, he has the executive authority to roll back all of Mr Obama's diplomatic overtures to the communist island, including relaxed sanctions and travel restrictions - although he's kept his options open so far.\n\nThe president-elect also seems more likely to favour closer relations to Israel and a renewed attempt at improving relations with Russia (a re-reset). In Syria, he has criticised Mr Obama's actions but hasn't advocated a coherent counter-policy, so there's no telling how - or if - he'll change course.\n\nOne thing is for certain, however. At least rhetorically the Trump administration will be a marked departure from Mr Obama's internationalist foreign policy, which leaned heavily on co-operation and co-ordination with allies.\n\nThe long-term trend of declining crime rates continued over the past eight years, although a number of large cities have seen a recent uptick in their murder rates. While public safety was a 2016 campaign issue, much of Mr Obama's efforts while president were directed at criminal justice reform.\n\nIn 2010 he signed a law that brought the mandatory minimum prison time for crack cocaine possession - which disproportionately involves black drug offenders - more in line with powder cocaine sentences.\n\nIn January 2016, Mr Obama took a series of executive actions to limit the use of solitary confinement in federal prisons and provide greater treatment for inmates with mental health issues. He has also used his presidential power to commute the sentences of more than 1,000 non-violent drug offenders and supported a Justice Department policy that resulted in the early release of about 6,000 individuals.\n\nAlthough Mr Obama has backed bipartisan sentencing reform legislation in Congress, the 2016 presidential election - and Mr Trump's tough-on-crime rhetoric - has been attributed with frustrating those efforts.\n\nGun control wasn't a top priority for Mr Obama when he took office, but in the early months of his second term - after the 2012 mass shooting of schoolchildren in Newtown, Connecticut - Mr Obama made a strong push for greater restrictions on some types of military-style semi-automatic rifles and more thorough background checks for firearm purchases.\n\nThose efforts ran head-on into the National Rifle Association's formidable lobbying power, however, and aside from a few executive actions, no new policies were enacted. In 2015, Mr Obama told the BBC that his failure in this area was his greatest frustration as president.\n\nTrump-ability: Given that Mr Trump regularly painted a bleak picture of crime levels in the US, lamented that law enforcement was too constrained by \"political correctness\" and opined that prison inmates were being treated too well, it's safe to say he will pursue a decidedly different course on public safety than Mr Obama.\n\nSentencing reform - in limbo for the past year - will be an exceedingly low priority for Republicans in Congress now, and Mr Obama's gun-control executive actions are likely to face the chopping block.\n\nThere was a point, shortly after Mr Obama's re-election in 2012, where comprehensive immigration reform seemed inevitable.\n\nThe president and his fellow Democrats were in favour, and rattled Republicans saw granting permanent residency to some undocumented workers and streamlining the US immigration system as a means to curry favour with the growing bloc of Hispanic voters.\n\nA grass-roots revolt within the Republican Party derailed those plans, prompting Mr Obama to take a series of executive actions providing normalised status to undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children and the immigrant families of US citizens and permanent residents. (The latter policy has since been suspended during a protracted legal battle over its constitutionality.)\n\nWhile these efforts attracted widespread praise from pro-immigration activists and Hispanic groups, the Obama administration's policy of increasing removal of other undocumented immigrants has prompted some to call him the \"deporter in chief\".\n\nFrom 2009 to 2015, the Obama administration deported more than 2.5 million people - most of whom had been convicted of some form of criminal offence or were recent arrivals.\n\nTrump-ability: Mr Trump may very well drop the US defence of the portion of Mr Obama's immigration action that's currently under legal challenge. He could also unilaterally resume deportation of others given normalised status by Mr Obama's executive efforts, although that will be more controversial.\n\nThe president-elect has pledged to deport more than three million undocumented immigrants currently living in the US - including visitors who have overstayed their visas - although given Mr Obama's track record it may be a difference of extent, not substance.\n\nAt one point, Mr Trump was pledging to remove everyone not lawfully in the US - more than 11 million by most estimates - which would be a marked departure not just from Mr Obama's policies but those of every modern US president.\n\nWhatever his other successes during his time in office, Mr Obama's presidency was a beating for the Democratic Party.\n\nIn 2009, when Mr Obama was swept to power, Democrats had large majorities in the US Congress and control of 29 of 50 governorships. Since then, he has seen his party's power steadily erode. The House of Representatives has been in Republican hands since 2010; the Senate since 2014. Democrats control the governor's mansion in only 16 states.\n\nThe situation is even more dire in state legislatures - the proving grounds for young politicians with national ambitions. Republicans hold sway in 32 legislatures, while Democrats have majorities in only 12 (the rest are divided).\n\nIf the party doesn't make inroads in places like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Florida and Wisconsin by 2020, those legislatures will draw congressional district maps that make recapturing the House of Representatives a tall task for Democrats for another decade.\n\nMr Obama's political constituency - young voters and minorities - proved enough to win him the presidency twice, but it was a fragile coalition that could not be counted on in mid-term congressional and legislative elections or, for that matter, by Hillary Clinton last year.\n\nWhile Mr Obama can boast considerable accomplishments over his eight years in office, if his party can't regain its footing after a string of devastating electoral setbacks, he won't have any legacy worth writing about before too long.\n\nTrump-ability: Barring a major political realignment in the liberal fortress of California, things can't get much worse for Democrats at the state level. In Congress, however, Mr Trump has a decent shot at expanding the Republican Senate majority in 2018, given that Democrats have to defend 10 seats in states that Mr Trump won last year.\n\nThere's always the chance that Republicans could overreach in their efforts to enact their agenda. An economic decline or foreign policy fiasco could tank Mr Trump's approval rating and make winners of even unlikely Democrats.\n\nThe durability of Mr Trump's own political coalition of disaffected working-class whites, evangelicals and other traditional Republican voters is still an open question as well. While Republicans may feel the future belongs to them, when Mr Trump's time in the Oval Office comes to an end, there's no telling what kind of grades will his legacy receive.",

But the paper asks why, in a momentous week for the NHS, he chose to deviate from that subject.\n\nSimilarly, the Daily Mirror thinks the idea has flaws and has diverted attention from the NHS crisis - but says the leader of the opposition deserves credit for his willingness to contemplate radical answers to major problems.\n\nThe Financial Times believes many high earners would avoid any cap by setting themselves up as a company.\n\nThe main front page story in The Sun and the Daily Mail is the death of Katie Rough - the seven-year-old girl found seriously injured in a field in York.\n\nHer headmistress tells the Mail that Katie was kind, thoughtful and hardworking, with a particular talent for creative writing.\n\nThe number of cars clamped for non-payment of road tax has more than doubled since paper tax discs were abolished, according to figures obtained by The Times.\n\nThe paper also claims that savings made by the new online system have been dwarfed by losses from non-payment, as the amount of money collected has fallen.\n\nThe DVLA disputes the figures, but the Times says the DVLA has \"taken a wrong turning\" and that paper tax discs worked and it may make sense to reinstate them.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph and The Times report that Bath could become the first city in Britain to charge visitors a \"tourist tax\".\n\nCouncillors say the levy on all those staying in a hotel, or a bed and breakfast, would help pay for local services, offsetting \u00a337m in budget cuts they need to make. Venice, Paris and Berlin all charge hotel taxes.\n\nThe Times calculates that such a levy could raise millions of pounds for Bath - but says it would be likely to anger hoteliers.\n\nThe Telegraph and the Guardian both pay their own tributes to their legendary reporter, Clare Hollingworth, whose death was reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe Telegraph says that, as well as getting the \"scoop of the century\" - when she reported the outbreak of the Second World War - she helped more than 2,000 Jewish refugees flee Europe.",
