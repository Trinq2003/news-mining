            "section": "UK",
            "content": "The traditional exchange of gifts between the US and UK leaders has not always run smoothly - with leather jackets and trench coats among the notable rejections.\n\nBut some are the gifts that keep giving, with Queen Victoria's 1880 present - the Oval Office's Resolute desk - used by President Donald Trump on his first day in the White House.\n\nTheresa May presented the US president with a quaich, a traditional Scottish cup of friendship, while First Lady Melania Trump received a hamper of produce from the prime minister's country residence, Chequers.\n\nIn return, the UK prime minister was given a framed picture of Abraham Lincoln swearing the Oath of Office on the same copy of the Bible used by Mr Trump at his inauguration.\n\nMrs Trump, meanwhile, gave a pair of silver cufflinks by New York designer David Yurman to Mrs May's husband, Philip.\n\nBut how do these gifts compare to those exchanged by leaders past?\n\nMost presents held by UK government departments include works of art, watches, wine and jewellery.\n\nBut under the ministerial code of conduct, if government ministers want to keep a gift personally they are obliged to declare presents worth more than \u00a3140.\n\nSo while smaller gifts will remain unknown, news of some of the bigger - and stranger gifts - have been disclosed to the public.\n\nArtist Ben Eine, who has worked with Banksy, began his career by \"tagging\" his name on buildings\n\nOn his first trip to Washington as prime minister in 2010, David Cameron's official gift to President Barack Obama included a painting by a graffiti artist.\n\nThe work, Twenty First Century City, by Ben Eine, was said to be one of Mr Cameron's wife Samantha's favourite artists.\n\nMr Obama continued the art theme by presenting the Camerons with a signed lithograph by pop artist Ed Ruscha.\n\nThe piece, Column with Speed Lines, was chosen for its red, white and blue colours matching the British and American flags.\n\nWriting on his website, Ben Eine - who has worked with Banksy - said it had been a \"weird day\" because \"David Cameron has given one of my paintings to President Obama in an art swap\".\n\nThe Camerons gave the Obamas a table tennis table in a nod to the match the men played in 2011\n\nThe following year, Obama chose to give the Camerons a customised \"one-of-a-kind\" barbecue as a reminder of their time flipping burgers together in the 10 Downing Street garden during the Obamas' London visit in May 2011.\n\nIn return, the Camerons gave the president and his family a customised Dunlop table tennis table.\n\nIt's a nod to the match the two men played against school children in south London during the same 2011 trip.\n\nMrs Cameron also gave First Lady Michelle Obama a printed blue scarf by Scottish designer Jonathan Saunders, inspired by Victorian wallpaper.\n\nGordon Brown rejected the 'Camp David' jacket which was a present from George W Bush\n\nIn 2009, Mr Obama was criticised for lack of thought when he presented previous Prime Minister Gordon Brown with a set of 25 DVDs of classic US films, when Mr Brown visited Washington.\n\nMr Brown gave the US president a pen and holder carved from an anti-slavery ship and biographies of Winston Churchill, worth $16,510.\n\nPerhaps Mr Obama was trying to play it safe after Mr Bush's gift the previous year, of a fur-trimmed leather bomber jacket, had been rejected by Mr Brown.\n\nThe jacket was emblazoned with the presidential logo and featured Mr Brown's name.\n\nAll gifts over a certain value have to be declared by government ministers - but Mr Brown chose not to pay for the jacket, according to reports at the time.\n\nIt is not known if Tony Blair received one of the Camp David leather bomber jackets\n\nIn 2003, a list of presents given to President George W Bush since he had taken office in 2001 included a \u00a3216 sponge bag from Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nThe toilet bag was believed to have been a light-hearted reference to the president's comment on first meeting Mr Blair that they had at least one thing in common - the same toothpaste.\n\nIt had \"GWB\" embossed in gold on the top.\n\nMr Blair's gift was notably cheaper than some, with Russia's Vladimir Putin presenting a \u00a312,000 pen and Afghan President Hamid Karzai gifting a \u00a33,000 wool and silk rug. But it was not the cheapest on the list - Morocco gave Mr Bush a \u00a32 jar of fish bait.\n\n\"I'm sure he thought: 'What in the world is going on?' said Lyndon Johnson's personal ambassador\n\nLloyd Hand, who was the president's chief of protocol and personal ambassador at the time, told US National Public Radio: \"President Johnson opened the box and put the coat on, and the sleeves came about halfway on his arms.\n\n\"He said 'Lloyd, see if you can catch the prime minister and tell him this is the wrong size.'\n\nMr Hand said he stuffed the coat back in the box and raced down the steps, out of the diplomatic entrance and to the driveway where Mr Wilson was leaving.\n\nAs the prime minister's car rolled down the driveway, Mr Hand rapped on the window.\n\n\"I'm sure he thought: 'What in the world is going on?', and I told him the story and he laughed and said, 'Of course I'll get it and I'll get the right size and get it back to him,'\" he said.\n\nThe Resolute desk was moved into the Oval Office by President John F Kennedy in 1961\n\nConsidered one of the White House's \"treasures\" today, the president's desk in the Oval Office was a present from Queen Victoria to President Rutherford B Hayes in 1880.\n\nKnown as the \"Resolute desk\" it was made from the oak timbers of the British ship HMS Resolute and has been used by every president since Mr Hayes, apart from Presidents Johnson, Nixon and Ford, according to the White House Historical Association.\n\nIt was first used in the Oval Office in 1961 at the request of President John F Kennedy.\n\nSir John is not the only recipient of an Akhal-Teke stallion - Russia has presented one to Bahrain\n\nSome of the more unusual gifts showered on our UK leaders in recent years may not have come from the US, but have included Mr Blair's Segway scooter - presented by the King of Jordan, and a bronze fox from the government of Belgium.\n\nOther presents received by Mr Blair included an electric car from the president of Ferrari and three guitars - one of them from rock star Bryan Adams.\n\nBut perhaps the stand-out gift of note is Sir John Major's \"gift horse\".\n\nIn 1993, then-Prime Minister Sir John was presented with a framed photograph of a horse called Maksat, a pure-bred Akhal-Teke stallion, by the President of Turkmenistan.\n\nThe only snag was that the animal was in Turkmenistan and the UK was expected to collect it.\n\nSir John decided he wouldn't have been able to keep the animal, so the Household Cavalry decided to take it, leading to one of the strangest assignments ever taken on by a British diplomat.",

            "description": "BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner asks what would happen if Mr Trump brought back torture.",
            "section": "US & Canada",
            "content": "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nPresident Trump has indicated that he is considering a return to the sort of harsh interrogation techniques of \"enemy combatants\" that have been widely condemned as torture, as well as a return to so-called CIA \"black sites\".\n\nIn his first interview since becoming US President, Mr Trump said intelligence officials had told him that \"torture absolutely works\", but that he would defer to advice from his new CIA director and his secretary of defence. The latter, retired Marine Corps officer Gen James Mattis, says torture does not work.\n\nSo what are the global implications if the president goes ahead, asks BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner.\n\nThere is a South African proverb, dating from the apartheid era, that goes like this: \"How do you catch an elephant? You catch a mouse and keep beating it up until it admits it's really an elephant.\"\n\nRidiculous as this may sound, there is an echo of truth here. Torture hurts. That's the whole point of it.\n\nSo if someone is tortured badly enough they will say anything to make it stop, including making things up that they think their tormentors will want to hear.\n\nPrisons in certain Middle Eastern countries, especially Syria, are crammed full of people who are being abused so badly they will eventually sign any \"confession\" to make the treatment stop. In some countries forced confessions remain to this day the primary tool in the prosecutor's armoury.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in 2001 the US intelligence community, having failed to prevent the worst attack on the US since Pearl Harbor, became convinced that a second catastrophic attack was on its way.\n\nAs President George W Bush's \"war on terror\" got underway, the normal safeguards of respect for human rights and the rule of law were cast aside in a desperate hunt to find \"the ticking bomb\".\n\nTop al-Qaeda planners like Ramzi Bin Al-Shibh, Abu Zubaydah and Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, all caught in Pakistan, were \"rendered\" (transported) to so-called \"black sites\" for extreme interrogation. These were secret, unacknowledged prisons, run by the CIA and scattered around the globe in Afghanistan, Thailand, Poland, Romania and other countries.\n\nThere they were subjected to repeated waterboarding, which makes the bound and helpless victim feel like they are drowning. Khaled Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded a staggering number of times, well over 100.\n\nAnd yet years later, when in 2014 the US Senate's Intelligence and Security Select Committee issued its report on the use of torture under the Bush administration it concluded that torture was \"not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees\".\n\nOn Thursday, the US House Speaker, Paul Ryan, said torture was not legal and that the committee agreed it was not legal. Senator John McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, also opposes it.\n\n\"The president can sign whatever executive order he likes,\" he said, \"but the law is the law. We are not bringing back torture in the USA.\"\n\nThere would be strong resistance too from both America's allies and from within the intelligence community itself.\n\nThere is a general acceptance now, in most of the world, that those practices carried out in the early years after the 9/11 attacks - extraordinary rendition, detention without trial, enhanced interrogation - were not only morally wrong, they were also counter-productive.\n\nThey very rarely produced useful, actionable intelligence. They traumatised not only the victims, some of whom were completely innocent, but also those who witnessed the shocking dehumanising of an individual. Undoubtedly this has given the green light to some unscrupulous practices by regimes who see America's earlier use of torture as a license to do what they like to their own citizens.\n\nUnthinkable as it sounds now, the US even rendered one \"high value detainee\" to his own country - Syria - for interrogation, knowing that there would be few restraints on his treatment there.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. John McCain said he'd have Donald Trump in court in 'a New York minute' if he reinstated waterboarding\n\nThere is also the legal aspect. In 2010 David Cameron, who was then UK prime minister, set up a judge-led, independent inquiry into allegations of complicity by MI5 and MI6 officers in torture.\n\nCareer intelligence officers who had thought they were doing the right thing at the time - such as, hypothetically, being within earshot of the harsh interrogation of a suspect in a Pakistani jail - found themselves being questioned by detectives from the Metropolitan Police.\n\nThe inquiry was eventually scrapped but it has at least led to a widespread rethink on respect for human rights inside intelligence agencies on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nSenior intelligence officers who lived through this difficult period are likely to strongly resist turning the clock back and returning to those days.\n\nIt is also questionable whether the US would find willing partners to host black site prisons amongst those countries only too relieved to have closed that chapter in their national histories.",

            "description": "What's the secret behind the unstoppable rise of these side-splitting sidekicks?",
            "section": "Entertainment & Arts",
            "content": "The pair were honoured for services to broadcasting and entertainment\n\nThe nation's favourite TV duo Ant and Dec were given the royal seal of approval today when they were awarded OBEs for services to broadcasting and entertainment by the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace.\n\nEarlier this week they scooped three prizes at the National Television Awards, including best TV presenter for the 16th year in a row.\n\nBut why do we love these cheeky chums so much? What's the secret behind the unstoppable rise of these side-splitting sidekicks?\n\nThe duo's first presenting job was on CBBC's The Ant & Dec show in 1995\n\nTV producer Conor McAnally witnessed the transformation of Ant and Dec from success-hungry teenagers to grown-up lovable comrades. He saw instant potential in the two when they took on their first proper presenting gig on The Ant & Dec Show in 1995 on CBBC.\n\n\"As a producer, you're looking for that spark in a new presenter,\" says McAnally. \"Someone who can reach through the camera and grab an audience. Presenting skills, technical skills, hitting your marks, all that sort of stuff is less important in the initial stages because all that can be trained.\n\n\"But with Ant and Dec there was a symbiosis. They were each other's genuine best friend. They each thought the other was the funniest guy in the world. They wanted to hang out all the time, even off camera. You can't fake that.\n\n\"These guys could dance, they could sing, they could act, and they could talk to the camera like it was their best friend.\"\n\nThey got their first break in 1989 on children's drama Byker Grove. Unusually, Dec is on the left in this picture\n\nIt's Ant and Dec's uncanny knack for talking directly to their audience that lies behind their genius. To many, it feels like watching friends rather than frontmen.\n\nThick Geordie accents have helped to forge this bond with viewers - in a 2010 survey by call centre managers Sitel, Geordie was found to be the UK's friendliest dialect.\n\n\"They seem so natural and so off the cuff, but most people don't know that is because they work very, very hard,\" McAnally continues. \"Their early training as actors meant they really studied their scripts.\n\n\"Beyond that, they really go down in to the essence of the show. What's it about? What's their role in it? What are they bringing to the audience? They're both great students of entertainment television.\"\n\nBehind the seemingly effortless on screen camaraderie lies an unparalleled understanding of TV expertise, believes McAnally.\n\n\"They're both really canny business guys. They understand their value. They understand the business end of television and rights and royalties and the value of the shows they've done. They're sometimes very tough negotiators.\"\n\nAnt and Dec also fronted Pop Idol from 2001-03, which brought back talent shows to prime time TV\n\nWhile Ant and Dec have mastered being front of the camera, they also perfected the art of being behind it.\n\nOver the years the pals struck numerous lucrative TV rights deals through their production companies Gallowgate, which they sold in 2012, and Mitre, launched in 2013.\n\nAs rights holders for many of their productions, in 2015 they pocketed a reported \u00a31m per episode to license Saturday Night Takeaway to US networks.\n\nThe series bombed across the pond - perhaps because its host Neil Patrick Harris couldn't recreate the Geordie duo's mischievous magic - but it didn't stop them netting a cool \u00a315m by the time the series was axed, contributing to their total net worth of around \u00a362m.\n\nAnt & Dec have won the best TV presenter prize at the National Television Awards for 16 consecutive years\n\nIt's this TV prowess which has prevented Ant and Dec from becoming over saturated, despite having touched almost every audience demographic.\n\nToday, their three biggest shows - I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here!, Saturday Night Takeaway and Britain's Got Talent - each run for short bursts at a time, with gaps in between long enough to leave audiences wanting more.\n\nPerhaps Ant and Dec's biggest appeal is that they seem at home on screen. We've watched them grow up and adapt to the challenges of 21st Century television.\n\n\"As people they became more and more confident and comfortable with being Ant and Dec,\" says McAnally. \"When I started working with them on The Ant & Dec Show, they had been PJ and Duncan.\n\n\"It was a transition period when they went from playing characters on television to playing themselves, but they tackled that head on. Each new show brought new challenges and new opportunities to expand what they could do on screen.\"\n\nNot every challenge resulted in new opportunities of course, but the pair have taken each bump on the road to stardom with grace and humility.\n\nMost notably, their 2008 attempt to bring gameshow Wanna Bet? to US audiences was branded \"unintelligible\" by critics. It was cancelled after six episodes due to issues with viewers being unable to understand the duo's Geordie accents as well as the dull format.\n\nThe pair signed a new three-year deal with ITV in November\n\nAfter The Ant & Dec Show, McAnally went on to produce five more shows with the pair - Ant & Dec Unzipped, Slap Bang, Friends Like These, CD:UK and SMTV. But it wasn't always plain sailing.\n\n\"There were moments where I wondered whether they would stick together. It happens a lot with duos, because working together over extended periods of time inevitably leads to conflict.\n\n\"They both had slightly different ambitions, but they both understood that their friendship was bigger than anything, and that working on their own wasn't as fun. It was a case of one plus one makes four, not two.\"\n\nIn November, the Geordie duo signed a new deal with ITV rumoured to be worth \u00a340m which will see them stay exclusively with the channel for another three years. So there's no chance of them slipping off our TV screens any time soon.\n\nMcAnally concludes: \"There might be better presenters out there in a technical sense, but they absolutely deserve every single award they get, because no one else has ever gotten in to the hearts of the UK population like Ant and Dec.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

            "content": "Theresa May's upcoming meeting with Donald Trump features on many of the front pages\n\nThe Daily Telegraph focuses on Prime Minister Theresa May's promise that there will be - in the words of its headline - \"no more wars like Iraq\".\n\nIt says she was cheered by Republican politicians on Thursday night as she made what the paper sees as \"the biggest shift in UK foreign policy for more than 20 years\".\n\nMrs May, the paper's editorial argues, is \"embracing realism\" in a change that in many ways mirrors that outlined by Donald Trump.\n\n\"May buries Blair doctrine in nod to US,\" is the headline for the Financial Times.\n\nIt believes she was, in some respects, bowing to the inevitable, but notes what it sees as her \"plea to the president\" on the duty of both countries to provide world leadership.\n\nIt says she received rapturous applause after vowing \"no more failed foreign wars\" and welcomes what it calls \"an end to the era of Blair follies\".\n\n\"Let's stand together and halt eclipse of the West\" is the headline for the Times, which believes the main message of the prime minister's speech was urging President Trump not to shirk his \"obligation\" to lead the world.\n\nIt says she also matched parts of Mr Trump's controversial foreign policy, including admitting it was time to engage Russia in the search for peace in Syria.\n\nBut, for the i, Mrs May invoked the \"spirit of the Cold War\", warning the president that the UK and the US needed to engage with the Kremlin from a position of strength.\n\nThe Sun believes her \"radical change of course\" was a \"direct slap-down\" to David Cameron on Libya, as well as to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown for Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThere is also much coverage of the prime minister's comment about Mr Trump that \"sometimes, opposites attract\".\n\nFor the Times, Mrs May's response was \"verging on the coquettish\" - acknowledging there are few obvious connections but allowing, it says, for \"the possibility of a spark\".\n\nThe Guardian's editorial cautions it would be naive for her to treat the visit as \"traditional statecraft\" but says it is not impossible she may be able to steer the president towards more balanced approaches - \"she must try\", it says.\n\nThe Financial Times believes her upbeat comments did little to conceal the complexity of developing the special relationship when, it says, she disagrees with Mr Trump on many fundamental issues.\n\nThe Daily Mirror believes her remarks risk enraging millions of women.\n\nIt says it hopes she can secure the best outcome for Britain, without having to get too close to what it calls \"this odious and increasingly offensive leader\".\n\nBut the Sun argues it does not matter what anyone in Britain personally thinks of the new president, even Theresa May; \"her sole duty\", it says, is \"to promote Britain's interests\".\n\nThe Telegraph's cartoonist, Bob, captures \"the special relationship\", as Mr Trump looks into a mirror.\n\nThe i newspaper says the prime minister has \"a superb chance to recast Britain's relationship with America\" and advises that to command Mr Trump's respect she must \"show the forceful confidence of a world leader\".\n\nThe Telegraph reports that Mrs May is preparing to abandon plans for a British Bill of Rights after leaving the EU.\n\nIt quotes government sources as saying plans to scrap the Human Rights Act - already shelved until after Brexit - may now be abandoned entirely, because the sovereignty of British courts will already be significantly strengthened.\n\n\"Corbyn facing MPs' Brexodus\" is the headline for the Daily Mirror, after Tulip Siddiq quit as shadow education minister in response to the Labour leader ordering his MPs to vote to trigger Article 50.\n\nIt says Mr Corbyn is facing a walkout by his frontbench team, while the Mail reports what it calls a \"farcical development\" - the party whip, Thangam Debbonaire, apparently telling MPs she will vote against the bill.\n\nBut, the i says, while the bill has reinforced Labour divisions, several shadow cabinet members known to be worried appear to have fallen in behind Mr Corbyn.\n\nThe lead for the Daily Express is what its headline describes as a \"huge boost\" for pensions.\n\nIt says payouts have surged to their highest level since the financial crisis in 2008, thanks to what the paper calls Britain's Brexit boom.\n\nFor the Daily Mail, the main story is what it calls the new pain threshold test designed to save the NHS millions: denying patients hip or knee replacements unless their pain is so severe they cannot sleep through the night.\n\nIt says three health trusts in the Midlands hope to slash operations by a fifth.\n\nThe Times says \"the latest NHS rationing plans\" come as the number of such operations is increasing by about 8% a year.\n\nThe Times reports that visitors to Britain face the prospect of a tourist tax to stay in popular cities, as councils \"scramble to raise cash to pay for local services\".\n\nThe paper says London Mayor Sadiq Khan will today back charging visitors a hotel levy in a move that could raise tens of millions of pounds for City Hall, and which, if successful, could be replicated up and down the country.\n\nThe British film industry is, according to the Guardian's headline, \"flying high thanks to Superman and Star Wars\".\n\nThey are among 200 movies that began shooting in the UK last year, 48 of which were funded overseas with a total spend of \u00a31.6bn.\n\nThe i points out that the three most successful films in 2016 were made here: Rogue One, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and Bridget Jones's Baby.\n\nAnd finally, a study about canine musical tastes produces a panoply of puns.\n\n\"Pooch-ini? Bach?\" asks the Mail, \"no, your dog would rather listen to reggae.\"\n\nThe Telegraph says the research by the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Glasgow University suggests they prefer music \"with a little more bite\", with soft rock also said to make dogs calmer and more relaxed.\n\nThe i, which dubs them \"Super woofers\", says the charity now intends to install sound systems at all its kennels.",

            "section": "Technology",
            "content": "Robots are finding their way into the classroom\n\nClassrooms are noticeably more hi-tech these days - interactive boards, laptops and online learning plans proliferate, but has the curriculum actually changed or are children simply learning the same thing on different devices?\n\nSome argue that the education this generation of children is receiving is little different from that their parents or even their grandparents had.\n\nBut, in a world where artificial intelligence and robots threaten jobs, the skills that this generation of children need to learn are likely to be radically different to the three Rs that have for so long been the mainstay of education.\n\nThe BBC went along to the Bett conference in London in search of different ways of teaching and learning.\n\nA stone's throw from the Excel, where Bett is held, stands a new school that is, according to its head Geoffrey Fowler, currently little more than a Portakabin.\n\nDespite this, the London Design and Engineering university technical college - which caters for 14- to 19-year-olds - was massively oversubscribed when it opened its doors for the first time in September.\n\nThe 180 pupils lucky enough to have got a place have had a very different experience of the curriculum in the 12 weeks since they joined.\n\nOne group have designed from scratch a virtual reality environment that takes viewers on a journey around an Ethiopian village as part of a project to highlight the work of the charity Water Aid.\n\nAnother has spent the term teaching Pepper - the school has two of SoftBank's human-looking robots - how to make a variety of moves, including the dab currently beloved of children around the country.\n\nGeoffrey Fowler (far right) showed off Pepper, with some of his pupils, teachers and industry partners at the Bett conference\n\nA third group are heading off this weekend on an unusual skiing trip. Travelling with them will be 11 Nao robots, which the pupils plan to teach how to ski.\n\nThe school - which sets no homework, relying instead on pupils wanting to get on with their projects in their own time - is, according to Mr Fowler, \"inspiring children to be part of a new type of learning\".\n\nWhile other schools may see the projects listed above as fun \"add-ons\" to the core curriculum, Mr Fowler thinks it has to be embedded within it.\n\nSixth-formers work on what is called an extended project qualification, which is the equivalent of half an A-level.\n\nThe school works with a range of industry sponsors, including the University of East London, Thames Water and Fujitsu, all of which offer input into the types of skills they would like to see children learn to equip them for the workplace as well as offering apprenticeships.\n\nThere are 48 university technical colleges (UTC) in England currently - and the scheme has proved controversial.\n\nOne set up in East London in 2012 closed after just two years, having failed to attract enough pupils, while another in Bedfordshire was branded inadequate by Ofsted.\n\nSome head teachers seem to be resisting the idea of the vocational style of education, barring UTCs from recruiting pupils from their schools.\n\nBut statistics suggest that pupils attending UTCs have just as good results if not better than those in more conventional schools.\n\nIt is something James Culley, head of computer science at the school, sees for himself every day.\n\n\"I have never seen students learn so quickly,\" he told the BBC.\n\nOne group of children in an Indiana school are loving learning with drones\n\nLots of primary schools are now convinced of the importance of learning to code.\n\nAs well as lessons devoted to it, after-school code clubs proliferate as do DIY computers such as the BBC's Micro Bit and the Raspberry Pi.\n\nTynker, a company that has already brought its coding-through-games philosophy to 60,000 schools in the US, recently launched a new project - teaching coding through drone lessons.\n\nHundreds of schools in the US have taken up the idea and it is now preparing to launch in the UK.\n\nSchools typically buy between six and 12 drones via Tynker's partnership with drone maker Parrot and can then download Tynker's free set of drone lessons.\n\nThe children at Towne Meadow turn up early for drone club, said their teacher\n\nChildren learn to make drones do back-flips, as well as more complex idea such as drones working together as a team.\n\nIt would take, you may think, a rather brave teacher to commit to flying drones in the classroom, but Josie McKay, a Fourth Grade teacher at Towne Meadow Elementary School in Indiana has no such qualms.\n\n\"Over the last month, I have seen their confidence build as they went from coding their drone to hover off of the floor to flying their drone around the room without crashing into any obstacles,\" she says.\n\n\"Each week these students develop new and more challenging goals for themselves, work together, and code their drone accordingly.\n\n\"The excitement on their faces when they achieve their goal, especially when it is completed in a short amount of time, is infectious.\"\n\nThe drones come with a range of safety features, including a \"classroom mode\" that means they take off extra slowly.\n\nChildren cannot take command of each other's drones, and there is an automatic stop button if inquisitive fingers come in proximity with the drone's blades.\n\nTynker founder and chief executive Krishna Vedati told the BBC: \"Our goal is not to create programmers but to offer coding as a life skill.\"\n\nVirtual reality and augmented reality could prove a huge boon to education\n\nPicture a classroom where, instead of handouts or text books, all pupils learn from their own headset - entering a virtual reality world to learn about the French revolution, or interacting with a hologram of the solar system to learn about space.\n\nAccording to Lenovo's global education specialist, Sam Morris, there are huge benefits from learning this way.\n\n\"We see AR and VR as the next frontier,\" he says.\n\n\"Early usage has suggested the devices engage pupils intently in tasks, improve group interactions and the ability to adapt to multiple disciplines.\"\n\nMicrosoft was at Bett showing off HoloLens - its recently released \"mixed reality\" headset.\n\nIt has worked in conjunction with Case Western Reserve University to develop a hologram of the human body that can be dissected and bones, organs and veins viewed in detail.\n\nIt is also working with education provider Pearson to develop other educational resources for the device.\n\nThe developer edition of HoloLens currently sells for \u00a32,719 which makes even buying one headset out of the reach for most cash-strapped schools.\n\n\"The declining cost of VR and AR devices will be critical to driving mass adoption in education,\" says Mr Morris.",

Which countries might be subject to Trump ban?\n\nA number of people vowed to stand in solidarity with America's Muslim population after Mr Trump's election in November, but Ms Albright's tweet appears to have inspired others to speak out - including Ms Bialik, who stars as Amy Farrah Fowler in the hit series The Big Bang Theory, one of America's most popular sitcoms.\n\n\"I'm Jewish. I stand ready to register as a Muslim in #solidarity if it comes to that,\" she wrote.\n\nLater, the outspoken Trump critic added: \"If we're registering people who you think are a threat, register white males too, since most serial killers & mass shooters are white males.\"\n\nActress Mayim Bialik, who plays Amy Farrah Fowler in The Big Bang Theory, is an outspoken Trump critic\n\nIt has been reported that the President will be announcing his new executive order on Thursday.\n\n\"Look, the president has talked extensively about extreme vetting,\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said, promising \"more action this week\".\n\nMany, including Ms Albright, a Czech immigrant, are highly critical of the move - which is rumoured to mean the US would accept no Syrian refugees.\n\n\"There is no fine print on the Statue of Liberty,\" she tweeted. \"America must remain open to people of all faiths & backgrounds. #RefugeesWelcome.\"\n\nMr Trump previously spoke of banning any Muslim from entering the United States.",

            "section": "UK Politics",
            "content": "Tam Dalyell was a political contradiction, an aristocratic Old Etonian who became a socialist politician.\n\nIt was he who articulated what became known as the West Lothian Question, which festered at the heart of Scotland's relationship with Westminster.\n\nA former Conservative activist, he became a thorn in the side of the Thatcher government.\n\nBut he won admiration from across the political spectrum as an honourable and principled member of parliament.\n\nThomas Dalyell Loch was born in Edinburgh on 9 August 1932.\n\nHis father Gordon Loch, a civil servant, adopted his wife Nora's maiden name in 1938.\n\nIt was through his mother that Dalyell later inherited the Dalyell baronetcy, although he never used the title.\n\nThe Suez crisis made him an opponent of British military intervention\n\nHe went to Eton before doing his National Service as a trooper with the Royal Scots Greys, having failed his officer training.\n\nAfter he was demobbed, he went to Cambridge where he was chairman of the University Conservative Association.\n\nIt was while working as a teacher that he experienced a political conversion, brought about by the Suez Crisis in 1956.\n\nThe debacle, in which Britain, together with Israel and France, unsuccessfully attempted to gain control of the Suez Canal, made a deep impression on him\n\nNot only did he join the Labour Party, but the aborted invasion made him a committed opponent of future British military involvement overseas.\n\nIn 1962, he won the seat of West Lothian in a by-election, fighting off a strong challenge from a future SNP leader, William Wolfe.\n\nLess than two years after he entered parliament, Dalyell was appointed parliamentary private secretary to Dick Crossman, then Minister for Local Government.\n\nDalyell (r) arrived at Westminster in 1962 as the newly elected member for West Lothian\n\nThe position of PPS was seen as the first step to a ministerial career, but Dalyell's independent stance on issues irritated the party establishment.\n\nThat irritation turned to anger in 1967 when he was heavily censured for leaking minutes of a select committee meeting about the Porton Down biological and chemical warfare establishment to the Observer newspaper.\n\nDalyell claimed he thought the minutes were in the public domain but he did not escape a public dressing-down by the Speaker.\n\nIn a parliamentary debate on devolution in 1977, Dalyell first proposed what would become known as the West Lothian Question.\n\nA vocal opponent of Scottish devolution, Dalyell contrasted the town of Blackburn in his own constituency, and Blackburn in Lancashire.\n\n\"For how long,\" he asked, \"will English constituencies and English Honourable Members tolerate at least 119 Honourable Members from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland exercising an important and often decisive effect on English politics?\"\n\nIt was Enoch Powell who coined the term West Lothian Question, in his response to Dalyell's speech.\n\nHe fought to uncover the truth about the Lockerbie bombing\n\nWhen Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979 she found Dalyell a persistent critic of her policies.\n\nHe supported the Troops Out movement in Northern Ireland and attacked the prime minister's proposed boycott of the Moscow Olympics.\n\nBut it was the Falklands War that raised his public profile. He described the conflict as \"like two bald men fighting over a comb,\" quoting the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges.\n\nHe strongly condemned the decision to sink the Argentine cruiser, General Belgrano, insisting the vessel had been steering away from the conflict when torpedoed by a British submarine.\n\nHis political opponents called him Daft Tam, ignoring the methodical and painstaking preparation he put into sourcing the facts to back up his arguments.\n\nHe was no slave to parliamentary protocol and was suspended from the House on numerous occasions, twice for calling Mrs Thatcher \"a liar\" over the Falklands campaign.\n\n\"She is a bounder, a liar, a deceiver, a cheat, a crook and a disgrace to the House of Commons,\" was one notable contribution during a 1987 debate.\n\nHowever, some felt that his intemperate language did nothing to win him support.\n\nFormer Conservative MP and later political commentator, Matthew Parris said that \"this element of personal vendetta seriously weakens his case\".\n\nDalyell was persistent in trying to uncover the truth about the Lockerbie bombing and consistently said he did not believe Libyan leader Colonel Gadaffi was responsible for the outrage.\n\nHe was, predictably, bitterly opposed to the Gulf War, \"Kuwait is the 19th bloody state of Iraq,\" and went to Baghdad in 1994 to negotiate with Iraqi foreign minister Tariq Aziz.\n\nThe election of a Labour government under Tony Blair in 1997 failed to deter Dalyell from speaking his mind.\n\nIn 1999, he decided that he would no longer vote at Westminster on purely English issues, defying a number of three-line whips.\n\nHe was one of 25 MPs who opposed military action in Kosovo. \"I am one of a dwindling number of MPs who have actually worn the Queen's uniform,\" he said.\n\nHe continued to live in the ancestral home\n\n\"Perhaps we are a bit less relaxed about unleashing war than those who have never been in a military situation.\"\n\nHe had little time for the New Labour project, describing Tony Blair as the worst of the eight prime ministers who had held power while he was a parliamentarian.\n\nIn 2001, he became Father of the House, the longest continuous serving MP, using his position to attack the US led invasion of Iraq.\n\n\"These are the thought processes of fantasist Americans who want to control the world,\" he said. \"I am appalled that a British Labour prime minister should have got into bed with a crew which has this moral standing.\"\n\nDalyell stood down from the House of Commons in 2005, after serving 43 years as an MP, first for West Lothian, then, from 1983, the redrawn constituency of Linlithgow.\n\nBehind Tam Dalyell's somewhat shambling and eccentric demeanour was a keen analytical brain and a passion for meticulous research.\n\nUnrepentant about his dogged approach, he claimed that \"you must not be afraid to be thought a bore\".\n\nHe was that rare thing among politicians, a man who stuck to his principles, regardless of how unpopular it made him.",

            "content": "The Gambia is one of the poorest countries in the world\n\nConsidering its population of less than two million, The Gambia accounts for a high proportion of those crossing the Mediterranean Sea to reach Europe. The BBC's Alastair Leithead asks whether the new president can change this.\n\nIn a tiny shop unit along a dark corridor and through a narrow alleyway in The Gambia's biggest market, Samba Ceesay is sorting through the clothes he has for sale.\n\nHe arrived back last November - just before the election - after 15 months away from home following what everyone here calls \"the back way\".\n\nIt's the well-trodden migrant path to Europe through Senegal, Mali and Burkina Faso to Niger, and then north through Libya to the coast, to risk a Mediterranean crossing.\n\nMr Ceesay, 26, got as far as Burkina Faso before he was captured by an organised crime syndicate.\n\n\"They said they would help me but they took everything I had - all my money and my things - and locked me up,\" he said.\n\n\"They threatened to kill me unless my family sent ransom money, but we have nothing. They held me for a month.\"\n\nEventually they released him, and despite having lost all his money he kept going.\n\nSamba Ceesay had a terrible experience trying to reach Europe\n\nHe reached southern Libya, but with no job or chance of making the money needed to cross the Sahara or pay for passage across the Mediterranean, he gave up.\n\nThe International Organisation for Migration (IOM) office in the migrant hub of Agadez in Niger, helped him return home to The Gambia.\n\nMr Ceesay's family were initially disappointed he hadn't made it - they'd supported his plan to head to Europe and try to earn money to send home.\n\nNow Famara Njie from the IOM is helping him re-integrate through training to help improve his chances of getting a job.\n\n\"If you don't make your way to Europe and you come back empty-handed without any means to re-start your life, it makes things very, very difficult to re-integrate yourself back in the community,\" he said.\n\nIt's known as \"irregular migration\" - most people leaving The Gambia are economic migrants, and for the size of the country there are a lot of them.\n\nThere are less than two million Gambians, and by percentage of population more people head to Europe than any other nation.\n\n\"It is a growing problem, because we've seen people from all walks of life - policemen leaving their jobs, teachers leaving their jobs embarking on this way,\" said Mr Njie.\n\n\"Minors - those who should be in school to complete their basic education\u2026 we have seen them embarking on this journey, which is a really, really very troubling situation for the country.\"\n\nTop women's football side, Red Scorpions, lost their goalkeeper, who drowned in the Mediterranean last year\n\nAcross The Gambia thousands of people are leaving their homes.\n\nLess than an hour's drive from the capital, in the village of Kitty, many people have left using \"the back way\".\n\nPeople here are poor and it's strikingly clear whose relatives have made it to Europe, because they are building fantastic new homes.\n\nMoney goes a long way here and so remittances are paying for gleaming tin roofs, houses with fancy pillars and large courtyards.\n\nThere are satellite TV dishes attached to the walls and plots of land cleared and pegged out waiting for construction to begin.\n\nIt's this obvious incentive which drives many people to risk everything.\n\nIn a dusty clearing in central Banjul, amid the beautiful, orange, late afternoon light, the Red Scorpions are training.\n\nThey're the country's top women's football team and many also play for the national side.\n\nTheir goalkeeper, Fatim Jawara, 20, went missing last year, and then word came that she and her friend had drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean.\n\n\"She was so friendly, humble, always laughing - we were like twins,\" said her brother Momodou Jawara, 36, sitting with a photograph of her wearing her football strip.\n\n\"Thousands and thousands of people have gone - I wish I knew why.\n\n\"I don't have that kind of mentality, but what we believe is people always talk about greener pastures, wanting to be out doing something for their family as most of them complain about a lack of jobs.\"\n\nHe thinks she might have gone to try and play football in Europe \"but I'm not in her mind, and I'm not sure what put her in it\".\n\nFatim Jawara: She was so friendly, humble, always laughing, says her brother\n\nWith the return of new President Adama Barrow, there are great expectations that life will improve after 22 years of Yahya Jammeh's rule.\n\nUnder Mr Jammeh, human rights and freedom of speech were not respected. While this might change with a new government, it will be more difficult to raise living standards in what is one of the poorest countries in the world.\n\n\"It will take time. What kind of factories are we going to build, what kind of industry are we going to provide for the youths?\" asks Mr Jawara.\n\nA huge deposit of oil was recently found off the coast of neighbouring Senegal.\n\nIt's believed that find may extend into Gambian territorial waters, which could provide a huge boost to the economy over the coming decades.\n\nThe new president will serve just three years and is barred from standing in the next election, so it's hoped he can focus on laying foundations for the economy to improve.\n\nBig new houses built in poor villages show what reaching Europe means\n\nBut people have high expectations, which will be hindered by the complexities of coalition politics.\n\nSeven different political parties joined forces, plucking Mr Barrow from relative obscurity to drive President Jammeh from power.\n\n\"This new government coming in will help the youths to have more job opportunities, schools will be available for them. I can see a bright future for the Gambian youth,\" said striker Adama Tamba, 18.\n\n\"This new government, it will help us a lot,\" agreed Fatou Fatty, 19, the captain of the national team.\n\nBut there's a lot of work to do to prevent people being lured to take \"the back way\" to bring money home and lift their families out of poverty.",

It claimed such toys could deter girls from getting into science-based careers.\n\nBut a number of women who work in that field contacted the BBC's Family and Education News Facebook Page to say they disagree.\n\nWe went to meet Jade Leonard, a 30-year-old welding engineer for Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant.\n\nShe told us: \"Growing up I adored my Barbies, my dolls, dressing up, make up and all things girly. None of this influenced my decision to get a maths degree or my BEng.\n\n\"Love, encouragement and reassurance of what I was good at from my parents, sister and school teachers did. This gave me the confidence to go for what I wanted to do, whether I liked the colour pink or not!\"\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook",
