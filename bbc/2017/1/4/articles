John Nixon says Saddam Hussein was the most secretive man he has ever met\n\nWhen former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was captured in December 2003, the CIA required a specialist who could identify and interrogate him for information. That person was John Nixon.\n\nMr Nixon had studied Saddam Hussein since joining the CIA in 1998. His role was to gather insight into leaders around the world, analysing \"what made them tick,\" he tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.\n\n\"When a crisis hits, policy makers come to us with the questions about who these people are, what they want, why are they doing this.\"\n\nHe had been in Iraq when the ousted leader was discovered by US troops in a small, underground hole next to farm buildings near his hometown of Tikrit.\n\nWhen the news of Hussein's discovery came through, the US needed him to be identified - a task presented to Mr Nixon.\n\nThere had been rumours at the time that Saddam Hussein had numerous body doubles, but Mr Nixon - who left the CIA in 2011 - says \"there was no doubt in my mind as soon as I saw him, that it was him\".\n\nThe \"spider hole\" where Saddam Hussein was hiding when he was captured\n\n\"When I started talking to him, he gave me the same look he had on a book that had sat on my desk for years. Surreal doesn't come close.\"\n\nMr Nixon took on the role of interrogator and was the first person to question Saddam Hussein at length, doing so across a number of days.\n\n\"I had to keep pinching myself that I was questioning the most wanted man in the world. It seemed ludicrous,\" he says.\n\nMr Nixon, author of Debriefing the President: The Interrogation of Saddam Hussein, describes the former leader as a \"mass of contradictions\".\n\nHe saw \"the human side\" of Saddam Hussein, he says, in great contrast to the depiction presented by US media.\n\n\"He was one of the most charismatic individuals I've ever encountered. When he wanted to be he could be charming, nice, funny and polite.\"\n\nBut he could also switch to a much darker side. Mr Nixon describes him as rude, arrogant, nasty and mean-spirited - and scary when he lost his temper.\n\n\"There were two or three occasions when my questioning got on his bad side,\" Mr Nixon says.\n\nHussein had been unrestrained as he sat in the small, dingy room in which he was interrogated, sitting on a metal, foldable chair.\n\nOnly Mr Nixon, a polygrapher and an interpreter were also present in the room.\n\nNevertheless, Mr Nixon says the former leader - as a narcissist - \"liked the interaction he got by talking to me\".\n\nAt the end of the first session, in which Mr Nixon tried to establish a rapport with Saddam Hussein in the hope he would cooperate, Saddam said he had enjoyed the conversation.\n\n\"He had been in hiding for months and hadn't had many conversations,\" Mr Nixon says.\n\nIt was a positive start, but the next day Mr Nixon says Saddam Hussein \"came back more suspicious\".\n\n\"He is one of the most suspicious men I've ever met - every question I asked him he had one for me.\"\n\nMr Nixon admits the CIA had little to offer Hussein in the way of an incentive to speak.\n\n\"We had to appeal to sense of history and the prospect of him getting his views heard on record, and by the highest of powers in the world.\"\n\nIn 2006, Saddam Hussein was convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to death by hanging\n\nThere were certain subject areas he was required to cover by the CIA, but otherwise he was left to his own devices.\n\n\"I knew I had to try and get answers.\n\n\"Working for the agency, you are taught how to debrief sources and make them into potential assets.\n\n\"But you have to be very careful as you don't want to risk not being able to extract the most information possible by going at a topic in the wrong way.\"\n\nThe most important subject area was that of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).\n\nThe US and UK had used allegations of Iraqi WMDs as a key reason for going to war.\n\nMr Nixon says \"it was all the White House wanted to know\", but - from his conversations with Saddam Hussein, his advisers and subsequent research to verify or dismiss his claims - he came to the conclusion that the former Iraqi leader had stopped the country's nuclear weapons program years before and had not intended to restart it.\n\nIt was a view that led him and his colleagues to be seen as \"failures\".\n\nHe was not invited to debrief President George W Bush until five years later, in 2008, following separate findings on Saddam Hussein from the FBI.\n\nMr Nixon is particularly scathing of President Bush, saying - as one of few people that have shaken the hands of both him and Saddam Hussein - he would rather spend time with the latter.\n\nPresident Bush, he says, was \"isolated from reality\", with advisers that would \"rally around him regardless and nod in agreement\".\n\n\"I used to think what we said at the CIA mattered and the president would listen, but it doesn't matter what we say, politics trumps intelligence.\"\n\nMr Nixon says he is \"ashamed\" of what has happened in Iraq since the ousting of Saddam Hussein.\n\nHe says the Bush administration gave no thought as to what events might take place after Saddam's removal, and - in light of the rise of extremist groups such as the so-called \"Islamic State\" - believes the region would have been better off had he remained in place.\n\nSuch claims have been dismissed by former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, who led the country at the time of the invasion.\n\nThe BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.\n\u2022 None Blair: World better because of Iraq War",

            "content": "Sir Ivan Rogers has quit as the UK's ambassador to the EU\n\nThe Daily Telegraph speculates about what the government will do now that the UK's ambassador to the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers, has stepped down.\n\n\"May to pick Brexiteer as our man in Brussels\" is its headline.\n\nThe paper has been told by senior Conservatives that ministers see his resignation as an opportunity to appoint someone who backs leaving the EU wholeheartedly.\n\nThe Telegraph says Number 10 had \"lost confidence\" in Sir Ivan, over what it describes as his \"pessimistic\" view of Brexit.\n\nThe Times has a two-page spread exploring events leading up to Sir Ivan's departure, and the possible fallout.\n\nUnder the headline \"Our man in Brussels gave everyone a reality check\", it suggest Sir Ivan was performing a vital function - trying to \"tell it how it is, even if his political masters did not like the message\".\n\nBut the Sun says it will not shed a tear for his departure.\n\n\"He was reportedly always happy to take no for an answer from Eurocrats,\" its leader says \"when Britain desperately needed someone to fight our corner in Brussels\".\n\nThere is anger in the Daily Mail about personal injury claims lawyers who advertise in hospitals.\n\nSimon Stevens, who is head of the NHS in England, tells the paper they should be banned from doing so.\n\nNHS boss Simon Stevens criticised what are known as ambulance-chasing lawyers\n\nHe says the legal firms cost the health service more than \u00a3400m a year in claims for alleged medical blunders.\n\nThe Mail agrees that they should be kicked out.\n\nUnder the headline \"Leeching off the NHS\", its leader says allowing them to advertise in hospitals is \"a grotesque act of self-harm\".\n\nThe Daily Mirror front page headline is \"The fattest of cats\".\n\nThe paper says that, by lunchtime on Wednesday, the bosses of Britain's biggest corporations will have already earned as much as the average person will be paid all year.\n\nIn its opinion column, the paper says \"inflated rewards for the overpaid elite aren't even linked to ability or performance while most of the country grafts hard for a relative pittance\".\n\nMembers of the French National Front are upset, according to the Guardian, about the apparent depiction of their party leader, Marine Le Pen, in the trailer for a new film called Chez Nous.\n\nFront National vice-president Florian Philippot is quoted describing it as \"scandalous\" and expressing outrage that the film is being released in February, two months before the French presidential election.\n\nBut the director of Chez Nous, Lucas Belvaux, defends his work, saying it is not against the National Front but about \"the populist message and how people relate to politics\".\n\nFinally, several papers report on the story of Stuart Wilson, an amateur archaeologist who bought a field in south Wales, dug it up - and found the remains of the ancient city of Trellech.\n\nThe Daily Express explains that, 12 years ago, Mr Wilson paid \u00a332,000 for the field suspecting there might be something worthwhile buried there.\n\nHe has since found evidence of streets, foundations, and even a well.\n\nThe paper's leader describes him as \"outstanding in his field\".\n\nThe Sun's headline is: \"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Landmark\".",

            "description": "In 1977 a woman thought she had finally tracked down the son she had abandoned as a baby. What followed was an extraordinary tale of deception and heartbreak.",
            "section": "Magazine",
            "content": "In 1977, Johanna van Haarlem finally tracked down the son, Erwin, she had abandoned as a baby 33 years earlier. She immediately travelled to London to meet him. What followed, writes Jeff Maysh, is an unbelievable story of deception and heartbreak.\n\nIt was a cold Saturday morning in April 1988 when a van full of detectives arrived outside the North London home of Erwin van Haarlem. The self-employed art dealer, 44, lived alone in sleepy Friern Barnet, a smattering of brick homes beside the grim North Circular ring road.\n\nThe Dutchman's apartment building on Silver Birch Close had become the centre of an investigation led by the British intelligence agency MI5. It suspected that Van Haarlem - whom neighbours described as an \"oddball\" - was not in the art business at all, but a sinister foreign agent.\n\nInside, Van Haarlem was hunched over a radio in his kitchen. He was still wearing his pyjamas, but his hair was parted neatly to one side. He was tuned in, as he was every morning, to a mysterious \"number station\". In his earpiece, a female voice recited numbers in Czech, followed by the blip-bleep of Morse code.\n\nAt 09:15 detectives from Special Branch, the anti-terror unit of London's Metropolitan Police, crashed into his apartment. Van Haarlem tried to lower his radio's antenna. It jammed. When he pulled open a drawer and grabbed a kitchen knife, an officer tackled him, and yelled: \"Enough! It is over! It is over!\"\n\nHidden among his easels and paintings, detectives discovered tiny codebooks concealed in a bar of soap, strange chemicals, and car magazines later found to contain messages written in invisible ink. Investigators suspected Van Haarlem was not really from the Netherlands, but was a spy for the UK's Cold War adversary, the Soviet Union.\n\nUnder a bright spotlight at a police station in Central London, Van Haarlem protested his innocence. Then, 10 days later, things turned really strange: a visitor arrived claiming to be the prisoner's mother. Johanna van Haarlem was a Dutch woman in her early sixties, who peered at detectives from behind huge glasses. Her son was no spy, she insisted, but an honest Dutchman - the child she had abandoned in 1944 and rediscovered 11 years earlier. The baffled detectives allowed her to visit their suspect.\n\n\"Tell me, I'm hearing all these strange stories,\" she said. \"You're not really a spy, are you?\"\n\n\"We have a saying that where you see the smoke, there will be a fire,\" Van Haarlem told her. \"But this time it is not true. Too much of the smoke and no fire. I did absolutely nothing that could harm England.\"\n\nJohanna sighed with relief. \"But why? Why all of this, then?\" she said.\n\n\"Don't ask me. Ask them.\"\n\nAnd then he noticed a tiny red spot on her forearm. The DNA blood test results from the Home Office laboratory indicated, with near certainty, that they were not related. Johanna van Haarlem broke down in tears as her world collapsed.\n\nJohanna van Haarlem was 52 on her first visit to London to meet Erwin\n\nOn 6 February 1989, at London's Old Bailey, prosecutor Roy Amlot told a jury that the defendant had stolen her son's identity.\n\n\"You may think that if he knew all along, it was a cruel thing to do to her,\" he said.\n\nThe trial captivated the press. The Daily Express described Van Haarlem as \"an old-fashioned... slick-suited spy who inhabited a world of dead letterboxes and secret codes\". Exotic beauties came forward to kiss-and-tell about their love affairs with the spy. But the most wounded victim stood in the witness box, the tragic Dutchwoman, Johanna van Haarlem.\n\nOn 4 March 1989, at 11:45, the judge sentenced Erwin van Haarlem to 10 years in prison for espionage. \"He is probably the first person to be tried at the Old Bailey under an alias,\" one senior Scotland Yard officer told a reporter. The \"spy with no name\", as the newspapermen called him, would take his secrets with him to his cell.\n\nAfter months of negotiation and false starts, I met Erwin van Haarlem on a spring day in Prague, in 2016. Although he had lived quietly as a free man for the past 23 years, spies famously do not talk. Introduced to me by the Czech crime journalist, Jaroslav Kmenta, Van Haarlem arrived at a restaurant near the city's Old Town Square, wearing a smart blue blazer. After carefully checking my identification he began, in accented English, to tell me his story.\n\nIt began on 23 August 1944, when he was born Vaclav Jelinek in Modrany, a small village near Prague. His father had owned a small bakery there, selling biscuits and ice creams, until the Communists took power. Young Jelinek enlisted in mandatory military service, and, as the Cold War intensified, he graduated to a position in the Czechoslovak Ministry of the Interior. He dreamed of military valour and excitement. But what he got was mind-numbing shifts and grunt work.\n\nOne day his superiors caught him studying German vocabulary instead of guarding a checkpoint in the snow. They marched him to an upstairs office where he expected disciplinary action. Instead he was introduced to two members of Statni bezpecnost - the Czechoslovak secret State police. The StB was a shadowy spy agency that reported directly to the Soviets.\n\nThe StB agents had studied his file and learned that Jelinek was defiant, a womaniser, highly intelligent, prone to violence, patriotic, and a risk-taker. In other words, perfect spy material. After careful training, they decided he was ready to begin an undercover mission abroad, spying on the West.\n\nThe StB searched through its files of missing persons and assigned Jelinek a false identity - that of a Dutch boy, abandoned at an orphanage in Holesovice, Prague, at the end of World War Two. The child had been born just one day before Jelinek.\n\n\"Your new name,\" they told him, \"is Erwin van Haarlem.\"\n\nHe applied for a Dutch passport, and arrived in London by train in June 1975. To the boy from Prague, it was an alien city swarming with traffic, fashion, and danger. He took a job at the 24th-floor Roof restaurant at the Hilton Hotel on Park Lane, Mayfair, hoping to spy on the Royals down the road at Buckingham Palace.\n\nAt night, he exchanged coded messages with his home country via radio. One of his first ideas was to try planting listening devices in the Queen's furniture, he recalls, though he and his bosses realised it was technically unrealistic.\n\nHis secret career was running smoothly until late 1977, when he received a disturbing message from Prague: \"YOUR MOTHER IS TRYING TO FIND YOU IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA WITH THE HELP OF THE RED CROSS. SHOULD THE RED CROSS FIND YOU, A MEETING IS TO BE AGREED WITH.\"\n\nHe read the message over and over again. In October of that year, Van Haarlem received a handwritten letter from Johanna van Haarlem. The Dutch embassy had given her his address, she wrote. She was thrilled to find him. As he had been ordered, the spy politely replied in November, enclosing some photographs. He began the letter: \"Dear mother\". When he sent a cordial invitation to visit him in London, she left immediately.\n\nJohanna woke up early on 1 January 1978, in a West London hotel. Her stomach was knotted with nerves. She stepped on to the street littered with the detritus of New Year's Eve. It was her plan to arrive early and check out her son's address. But on the opposite side of the street a familiar-looking young man walked past.\n\n\"Are you Mrs van Haarlem?\" the spy said, stopping in his tracks.\n\n\"Hello Mother, it's your son.\"\n\nThey embraced in the middle of the street. Johanna stepped back to look at him. Tears were rolling down her face.\n\n\"Your father did not have such dark hair,\" said Johanna, studying him. Then she commented that he was shorter than his father.\n\nInside his apartment a champagne cork popped as Johanna breathlessly told him her life story. The bottle had frozen in the refrigerator but Van Haarlem managed to pour a couple of glasses.\n\nShe had grown up in The Hague, in Holland, and was an 18-year-old virgin when she met his father on a train, in November 1943. Gregor Kulig was a Nazi. He was blue-eyed, 23, and Polish. Handsome. At a party four weeks later, she said, he raped her.\n\nAnd when her father discovered she was pregnant, he exploded. \"You are a sinner!\" he told her. He ordered her to take the child to a distant town and give him away.\n\nFull of sadness and desperation, in autumn 1944 Johanna travelled to Czechoslovakia by train. After a brief effort to survive there as a single mother, she walked into an orphanage in Holesovice, Prague. Sobbing, she kissed baby Erwin goodbye, and returned to Holland alone.\n\nHer father - a Jew who had joined the National Socialist Movement to protect his family - destroyed the adoption papers and banned her from ever speaking about her son.\n\nOver the years, dozens of letters arrived from the orphanage asking Johanna to take back her child. They went unanswered. But every year on his birthday, Johanna silently remembered her missing son, his name she could not even speak: Erwin van Haarlem.\n\nNow she had found him. As they finished their champagne, he took her hand in his.\n\n\"You have to believe it,\" he told her. \"I am your son.\"\n\nShortly after their emotional \"reunion\", Johanna invited Erwin to meet the Van Haarlem family in Holland. When the spy arrived at her bungalow in early 1978, one-by-one he shook hands with the whole family. They studied him like a specimen in a zoo. Johanna's niece approached Van Haarlem, and seemed to scan him from head to toe. Did she know?\n\n\"He has the nice Van Haarlem legs,\" she told the crowd, approvingly.\n\nBack in London, having a Dutch, Jewish mother only improved Van Haarlem's cover. His main task, the spy told me, was to gather information about Refuseniks, the Jews held in the Soviet Union despite their requests to emigrate, who had become political pawns in Cold War peace talks. He also gained prize information about underwater sonar chains, which alerted Nato to Soviet submarine movements.\n\nBritish defence journalist Kim Sengupta later described Van Haarlem in this era as \"a brilliantly successful deep penetration agent\", who, over the years, visited the Polaris submarine base at the British Admiralty's Underwater Research Unit, as well as \"a string of sensitive military installations\".\n\nFor these fantastic intelligence scores, Van Haarlem received a medal from the Soviet Union at a private party held in his honour in Prague.\n\n\"He moved a lot,\" Johanna later told a Dutch radio station. \"From that small apartment I visited the first time to bigger, fancier places\u2026 I had no idea why he moved so much. He was doing better and better, you could tell by his clothes, shoes and houses that he was going in the right direction.\"\n\nErwin showered Johanna with presents including a Wedgwood vase, a gold and sapphire ring, and a gold coin. But at heart he was tiring of this relationship with his \"fake\" mother. In his mind she was a Nazi, a fascist, and a collaborator with foreign soldiers. He recalls travelling to Holland to introduce a girlfriend to Johanna - keeping up appearances.\n\nInside the Dutch restaurant, folk music played and locals danced. Johanna got carried away, he said. A local man whirled her around the dance floor, and suddenly the spy saw her as a young girl, dancing with the Nazi soldiers.\n\nA blind rage swept over him like a fire. \"She is at that again,\" he thought. \"She never changes. She is 60!\" One of the men held Johanna close, and gave a friend a suggestive wink. It nearly tipped van Haarlem over the edge.\n\nSome time later, back in London, Van Haarlem's telephone shrieked. The blissful silence in his apartment was shattered. He sat up in bed and checked the time. It was 03:00.\n\n\"Dear son, I could not help it, I had to hear your voice.\" Johanna was slurring. Van Haarlem guessed she had been drinking. \"I will sell my house and come to London,\" she said. \"We will live together.\"\n\n\"I absolutely understand why you are so upset, Mum,\" he said. \"Of course it would be wonderful to live together, especially since our fate prevented us doing so in the past. Mum, you know what? Let's go to bed now and think about it overnight. I will call you tomorrow.\"\n\nHe slammed down the phone but could not drift back to sleep. He was growing increasingly concerned about her behaviour. He simply couldn't afford her to be a liability. His life depended on it. But there was little he could do - he was stuck with her.\n\nOn her next visit, mother and son were driving through Golders Green in North London when Van Haarlem forgot to give the right of way to another car. The other driver slammed on his brakes to avoid a crash.\n\n\"Sorry, friend!\" said Erwin pleasantly, with a wave of his hand.\n\nJohanna snapped. \"Why are you apologising?\" she shouted. \"You are so yielding, so soft! A typical Slav!\"\n\nVan Haarlem was shocked. \"He had the right of way,\" he said.\n\n\"Right of way! Right of way!\" she parroted.\n\nGripping the wheel, the spy fumed. \"You'll pay with interest for that,\" he thought. But he would never get the chance.\n\nOne afternoon in autumn 1986 Van Haarlem noticed two cars driving closely behind him, pulling manoeuvres he recognised from his spy training.\n\n\"They must be tailing someone,\" he thought. Then the penny dropped: \"They are tailing you! You stupid ass!\"\n\nHe had by now quit his job at the Hilton - after rising from a lowly waiter to assistant purchase manager. He had set up himself up as a freelance artist and art dealer, and paid cash for the unassuming flat in Friern Barnet.\n\nIt should have been the last place anyone would look for a foreign spy, but it soon became a hotbed of chicanery. There was the technician who came to \"fix\" his telephone, the new postmen, and the dedicated window cleaners who washed his windows not weekly, but seemingly daily.\n\nVan Haarlem was not the only one who noticed peculiar goings-on.\n\nMrs Saint, 61, who co-ordinated the local Neighbourhood Watch Scheme, said she telephoned the police in November 1987 to report strange noises and a \"Morse code\" interference which affected her television reception every night at 21:20.\n\nSoon afterwards, in April 1988, that mysterious van parked outside Van Haarlem's apartment.\n\nJohanna van Haarlem heard about the arrest on BBC radio. Then investigators arrived at her home and asked her to testify against the spy at his trial.\n\n\"When we finally made eye contact I felt hurt. I didn't see any sign of remorse, not a wink, no warmth, nothing,\" she said of the trial. A part of her was in denial, continuing to look in vain for a son's affection. \"He showed me coldness,\" she said, \"and looked at me like this was the end.\"\n\nVan Haarlem was sent to Parkhurst prison on the Isle of Wight. After five years, the end of the Cold War, and a hunger strike, he was released and deported to what had by then become the Czech Republic.\n\nI asked if he ever felt any compassion for Johanna.\n\n\"I had no pity whatsoever,\" he said.\n\n\"She was rather dominant and I had to put up with her. Sometimes I had enough of her,\" he added, describing many real mother-son relationships.\n\nDuring the five years he spent in a prison cell, he went on, one thing about his case remained a puzzle. It was a statement that Johanna made about how she found him. \"Without being asked,\" he told me, \"she said only on her own, from her own will, she started the whole action, trying to find me.\"\n\nFrom her own will. It was a funny thing to say, he thought.\n\nWas it a coincidence that Johanna's motherly instincts awakened just months after his application for a Dutch passport? Who else might have inspired her to track down her son, and why? We may never know, as Johanna van Haarlem died in 2004. However, the spy has his own theory.\n\n\"We thought she was under the guidance of MI5 or the Dutch security service,\" he said.\n\nCould Johanna also have been a spy? Though it seems unlikely, in this world of disguise and deception, anything is possible.\n\nAdapted from The Spy With No Name by @JeffMaysh (Amazon Kindle Singles), published today.\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.",

            "content": "Ndekela Mazimba, who works in PR, says Mother's Day helps her manage her period pain\n\nDiscussing female menstruation publicly is something of a taboo in Zambia.\n\nThis is no doubt why a provision in the country's labour law that allows female workers to take off one day a month is known as Mother's Day, even though it applies to all women, whether or not they have children.\n\nThe legal definition is not precise - women can take the day when they want and do not have to provide any medical justification, leading some to question the provision.\n\n\"I think it's a good law because women go through a lot when they are on their menses [periods],\" says Ndekela Mazimba, who works in public relations.\n\nMs Mazimba is neither married nor does she have children but she takes her Mother's Day every month because of her gruelling period pains.\n\n\"You might find that on the first day of your menses, you'll have stomach cramps - really bad stomach cramps. You can take whatever painkillers but end up in bed the whole day.\n\nMutinta Musokotwane-Chikopela says there are already too many holidays in Zambia\n\n\"And sometimes, you find that someone is irritable before her menses start, but as they progress, it gets better. So, in my case, it's just the first day to help when the symptoms are really bad.\"\n\nWomen in Zambia do not need to make prior arrangements to be absent from work, but can simply call in on the day to say they are taking Mother's Day.\n\nAn employer who denies female employees this entitlement can be prosecuted.\n\nMs Mazimba's boss, Justin Mukosa, supports the law and says he understands the pressure women face in juggling careers and family responsibilities.\n\nA married man himself, he says the measure can have a positive impact on women's work:\n\n\"Productivity is not only about the person being in the office. It should basically hinge on the output of that person.\"\n\nBut he admits there are problems with the current system in terms of losing staff at short notice and also the temptation for people to play the system:\n\n\"It could be abused in the context that maybe an individual might have some personal plans they wish to attend to so she takes Mother's Day on the day.\n\nNdekela Mazimba's (R) boss Justin Mukosa (L) is supportive of the law\n\nNot everyone is so supportive of Mother's Day, and there are many women among the critics.\n\nMutinta Musokotwane-Chikopela is married and has three children.\n\nShe has a full-time marketing job but never takes Mother's Day, arguing that it encourages laziness in working women.\n\n\"I don't believe in it and I don't take it. Menses are a normal thing in a woman's body; it's like being pregnant or childbirth,\" she says.\n\n\"I think women take advantage of that, especially that there's no way of proving that you are on your menses or not.\"\n\nMs Chikopela says the provision should have been made more clear in the law.\n\n\"The problem in Zambia is that we have too many holidays - including a holiday for national prayers. So I guess Mother's Day makes those that love holidays happy.\"\n\nWomen in Zambia are traditionally the primary care-givers in the family\n\nThe Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), the umbrella body representing the country's workers, is also a supporter of the law.\n\nBut the entitlement \"would have to be forfeited\" if a woman were to take it on a day that she was not on her period, says Catherine Chinunda, national trustee at ZCTU.\n\n\"We have been educating women about Mother's Day, telling them that on that day, they are supposed to rest and not even go shopping or do other jobs because that is wrong,\" she says.\n\nThe law itself provides no guidance about what is allowed and it would appear that very few, if any, employers have internal policy guidance in that respect.\n\nShe dismisses the idea that men should also get a day off every month, as has been suggested by some:\n\n\"Men sometimes go to drink and miss work\u2026. they don't know how it feels to be on menses.\"\n\nBut while praising the concept of Mother's Day, some argue that the reality is bad for business.\n\n\"Your superiors may have planned work for you to do and when you suddenly stay away from work, it means work will suffer, says Harrington Chibanda, head of the Zambia Federation of Employers.\n\nLawyer Linda Kasonde says the law recognises the important role Zambian women play in society\n\n\"Imagine a company that has a number of employees and six or seven take Mother's Day on the same day. What will happen to productivity?\" he asks.\n\nLabour Minister Joyce Nonde-Simukoko, a former trade union activist, tells me that Mother's Day was initially informally observed in the 1990s before eventually being brought into law.\n\nBut she has stern words for anyone thinking of using the entitlement to bunk off work:\n\n\"If you absent yourself yet you are found in a disco house, then it will not be taken as Mother's Day.\n\n\"You shouldn't even leave town, be found doing your hair or shopping. You can be fired. For example, somebody was found farming after taking Mother's Day and she was fired.\"\n\nOne of the problems with the law is that it does not make this explicit, leading to confusion among employers and employees alike.\n\nBut perhaps even more than the practical benefits, it is the intention and the spirit of the legislation that many Zambians support.\n\n\"The reason why mother's day is important within the Zambian context is that it recognises that women are the primary care-givers in our society - regardless of whether they are married or not.\"",

            "content": "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Amit Patel's guide dog, Kika, carries a camera which records the discrimination he can't see\n\nUnable to see the world around him, Amit Patel fitted his guide dog with a camera and set about recording evidence of the discrimination he faced but could not see.\n\n\"The city is a scary place. It's like someone put you in the middle of Trafalgar Square, turned you in a circle and said 'find your way home'.\"\n\nThat is Amit Patel's new reality after he lost his sight unexpectedly in 2012, 18 months after he got married.\n\nHe now relies on guide dog Kika to get him around the once familiar streets of London.\n\nBut the footage captured by his canine guide hasn't always shown a city willing to help him.\n\n\"The video came out of necessity,\" Patel says. \"Kika was getting hit by peoples' bags and she was getting a lot of abuse. A woman stopped me one day and had a go at me for holding everyone up and said I should apologise, which was a real shock.\"\n\nThe former doctor found a solution - attach a GoPro to Kika's harness and film every journey. Patel's wife, Seema, can then review the footage if it is felt there was something amiss about that day.\n\nAnd when alterations were made to a London train station the camera came into its own.\n\n\"I asked for help and no one came,\" Patel recounts. \"The video shows lots of staff standing around me and this one guy looking over many times.\n\n\"Eventually when the staff member actually came to me the first thing he said was 'sorry I didn't see you' and that really bugged me. He wouldn't say that to someone who wasn't visually impaired.\n\n\"It really makes me angry. It's the fact that someone is fobbing me off.\"\n\nAn image from Kika's footage of the Network Rail incident in London\n\nThe footage was sent to Network Rail giving Patel the \"valuable evidence\" needed to lodge a formal complaint about an incident he couldn't see.\n\n\"It made me feel vulnerable but having the footage was a godsend,\" he says.\n\n\"Having the camera, having the voice, having the actual scenario played out in real time it actually gives me something to go back to the company and say 'this is what happened to me and it needs to be sorted'.\"\n\nThe video had an impact and Network Rail investigated before giving further training to its staff.\n\nKika's camera captures an image of Amit on the London Underground\n\n\"While in this instance the event and associated disruption was not organised by or held at the station itself, we do recognise that the station can be a complicated place to navigate,\" a spokesman says.\n\n\"That is why we have hired many extra staff to look after passengers.\"\n\nFor newly blind Patel, standing alone for several minutes can feel like hours.\n\n\"One of the things I noticed with losing my sight is how lonely it is. If I'm travelling by public transport I will be the scared little boy sat in the corner. You can't listen to music because you're listening out for dangers or to station announcements.\"\n\nPatel says it is only since he lost his sight that he has become aware of the discrimination visually impaired people can face.\n\nPatel learned he had keratoconus - a condition which changes the shape of the cornea - in the final year of medical school.\n\nLenses to push the corneas back into shape stopped working and six cornea transplants were rejected by his body until he was told \"no more\".\n\nIt was a series of burst blood vessels which caused the unexpected loss of sight within 48 hours.\n\nPatel says: \"I woke up every morning thinking I'd get my sight back. For about six months I was quite shut off, depressed and I would go to the bathroom and have a cry.\n\n\"The one thing that stayed in my mind was that I would never see my loved ones. It was holding on to the last memories I had.\"\n\n\"There are taxi drivers who will see you and won't stop. You phone the company and they say they didn't see you, but you look at the footage and see them having looked at you and driving right past.\"\n\nOther incidents he says highlight a lack of thought - especially on London's Underground.\n\n\"People assume, because I have a guide dog, I can walk around them but they make us walk near the tracks or I can say to Kika 'find me a seat' and I'll put my hand down on one and someone will sit on it and refuse to get up.\"\n\nThe loss of his sight led Patel to change his life dramatically. The former University College Hospital doctor moved to New Eltham in south London so his wife didn't have to travel so far for work and wouldn't spend so much time away from him.\n\nThe view of New Eltham High Street from Kika's camera\n\nPatel says he had assumed, as a doctor, he would know where to get support, but he found that wasn't the case and he became frustrated at the simple mistakes he made - miscalculations led to stair falls and fingers were burnt from trying to find out how full his coffee cup was.\n\nBeyond the major life changes there were more subtle experiences too.\n\n\"Your balance goes awry. I felt like I walked on a cloud sometimes, and if I find a pair of shoes I'll buy three pairs because a change in grip makes a real difference.\n\n\"My hearing's increased and my sense of smell, and the way I touch things.\"\n\nThere have also been more unexpected side effects.\n\nThe camera has given Amit the confidence to go out alone with Kika and his baby son\n\n\"I have small pixels of light coming into my eyes and my brain interprets that as images. It'll put four pixels together and build a photo - so you may be sitting on the couch while thinking a car's coming towards you.\"\n\nPatel now supports people who have lost their sight unexpectedly and gives talks to community organisations using the GoPro footage to demonstrate what Kika sees.\n\nDespite all the challenges he has faced, including coming to terms with never seeing his baby son, Patel has accepted his new world.\n\n\"My life at the moment is so much more vivid, it's more colourful than it was when I had sight.\n\n\"It still fills me with dread leaving the house, because I have no control and am completely reliant on Kika, but we're out all of the time - any excuse.\"\n\nFor more follow on Twitter and Facebook and subscribe to the weekly podcast.\n\nJoin the BBC Stories conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",
