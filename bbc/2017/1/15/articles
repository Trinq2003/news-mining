            "content": "The City of London is braced for the chill winds of regulation\n\nFinancial institutions across the UK are gearing up for one of the most far-reaching regulatory shake-ups they have ever faced.\n\nThere's a five-letter acronym regularly muttered in the City of London, which leads to some rubbing of chins, looks of bewilderment and groans about the workload.\n\nThe acronym in question is Mifid 2, the name of a rather technical, complex and, yes, dull-sounding piece of financial legislation from the EU.\n\nIt stands for the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. Mifid 2 means big changes for banks across Europe over the next year.\n\n\"It's a complete system change, very detailed,\" says Anthony Browne, who runs the British Bankers' Association (BBA).\n\n\"It is changing their IT systems, changing the way their whole systems operate right from the front end and the information the traders put in to the back end and information they provide to clients; it's also the documentation they provide for their clients, and information they give to regulators themselves.\"\n\nThe rules run to more than 1,000 pages.\n\nThe new rulebook - or perhaps rule \"tome\", more accurately - is the EU's response to the financial crisis.\n\nA decade on from that scarring experience, the European Commission predicts the law will be transformative for markets.\n\nDespite the Brexit vote, the City still has to abide by the new EU regulations\n\nMany banks back the new rules, saying they will help avoid a rerun of 2007-08 by bringing in more transparency and giving investors greater protection.\n\nSome companies, though, say they are too tough and have already led to job losses.\n\n\"It is the unintended consequences that could be the problem here,\" says Julian Allen-Ellis from the EFMA financial markets trade body.\n\n\"The operational cost of both buy-side and sell-side setting up for this new regulation could mean profitability is impacted and that ultimately impacts the person on the street with their pension and their portfolio.\"\n\nA recent survey of the City by PA Consulting suggested two out of five companies were not prepared enough to implement the new rules.\n\nThey'd better get a move on. The sprawling regulations come into force in January 2018.\n\nThere are some who argue that these complex EU rules could be a big help to the City after Brexit, because they contain something called \"equivalence\".\n\nThat allows financial companies from outside the EU to do business inside it, as long as their home country has the same standards of regulation.\n\nThe City is wary of what Mifid 2 will usher in\n\n\"Potentially this could be a way through the mire,\" says David Biggin, an adviser at PA Consulting.\n\n\"For a lot of the companies talking about relocating, actually this rule might allow some light at the end of the tunnel. It's a technocratic decision rather than a political decision. It is a way forward.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone thinks \"equivalence\" will save the City's bacon if it finds itself with less favourable access to the EU than it has today.\n\n\"The main drawback is it can be withdrawn unilaterally at any time,\" warns the BBA's Anthony Browne.\n\nHe has other concerns too. \"This would be a political process done at a time when the UK is negotiating its divorce arrangements from the EU, and when it's thinking about negotiating a trade deal with the EU. The chance we would get agreement on equivalence, to come in the day the UK leaves the EU, seems hopeful at best.\"\n\nThe experience of some countries already outside the EU seem to bear that fear out.\n\nSeveral have already applied for \"equivalence\" status under previous financial rules.\n\nGuernsey is one of them. The Crown dependency has beefed up its laws, and they have been judged as technically the same as the EU's by an EU regulator, no less.\n\nGuernsey is now waiting for the European Commission to give it the final nod - and has been for two years.\n\n\"The technical decision was made. Now it's become a political decision,\" says Christopher Jehan from the Guernsey Investment Fund Association.\n\n\"That political decision is effectively the roadblock for us,\" he says. \"They're using whatever reason they have for anything else going on in the world as a delaying tactic.\"\n\nGuernsey's experience does not bode well for those in the UK who think these new complex EU rules will help the City after Brexit.\n\nBut Mifid 2 is already bringing about big regulatory change in the City, the scale of which it has rarely seen.",

            "section": null,
            "content": "It is too easy to score goals against Manchester City, but that is not Pep Guardiola's only problem at the moment.\n\nAs we saw in Sunday's 4-0 defeat by Everton, who scored with every shot they had on target, teams do not need to create many chances to get past City.\n\nThat is a criticism of their back four and their goalkeeper, but another reason they have fallen off the pace in the title race is their lack of threat going forward.\n\nIt was not difficult for Everton to defend against them at Goodison Park. Yes, City had a penalty shout and a couple of half-chances in the first half but at the moment, if you get back into shape against them and close off the gaps, then it is also easy to keep them out.\n\nCity's tempo when they come forward is not always quick enough. They are pretty predictable in attack and, in the Premier League, they are finding it hard to score goals against well-organised defences.\n\nThat means more pressure is being heaped on their own back four. Against Everton, they could not cope.\n\nStones not to blame for City's struggles\n\nIt would be very easy to come out after watching City lose 4-0 and say they were wide open at the back, and John Stones had a nightmare on his return to his old club.\n\nBut Stones was probably the best player in City's back four - it is the others who let him down, massively.\n\nIf you look at the four goals that City conceded against Everton, Nicolas Otamendi and Gael Clichy both make errors that lead to three of them. Stones was not at fault for any of them.\n\nEverton scored their first, second and fourth goals because either Otamendi or Clichy got their basic defensive positioning and decision making wrong.\n\nThat is not down to Guardiola's system or the way he sets his team up, it comes down to the mentality of his players, and them being alert and aware of danger - I am talking about things like their reaction time, staying in line with the rest of their back-four and staying with runners from the opposition team.\n\nFor example, with Everton's fourth goal, Stones will get criticised because his clearance was charged down and led to Ademola Lookman scoring.\n\nBut Otamendi was on his heels and not even thinking about defending when Stones went over to the left to clear. Yes, the ball dropped nicely for Lookman but Otamendi should have been ready for that.\n\nThe fact he wasn't is not down to Stones, but he seems to be getting the blame.\n\nIt seems to happen a lot. Stones has got unbelievable ability but he seems to have been carrying the can all season whenever City have conceded goals, no matter what their other defenders do.\n\nThat is partly because he is a \u00a350m signing and an England international, and partly because of the way he tries to play as a skilful centre-half - which is the way Guardiola wants him to play.\n\nGoals are going in easily against Bravo\n\nStones aside, it seems to me there are fundamental problems with City's defence.\n\nClaudio Bravo is one of them - it looks like people are playing City and thinking if they hit the target, they will score.\n\nTo win the league title, you need a goalkeeper who will make important saves. Look at all the champions over the last 10 or 20 years and you will find keepers who are worth around nine to 12 points a season to them with the stops they make.\n\u2022 None Listen: The Times' Henry Winter on why City are missing Joe Hart\n\nThat is not the case with Bravo at City. I saw him play in Spain when I was with Valencia last season and he is a fantastic keeper but the goals are going in very easily against him at the moment.\n\nIt is not even as if they are all going into the corners of the net - Bravo is being beaten in the central areas of his goal too.\n\nHe is definitely struggling in English football, with the speed, the intensity and the physicality of our game, and teams are 100% targeting him.\n\nHis confidence has taken a hit, which is inevitable, and it obviously does not help when you concede with the first shot you face in a game, which is what happened at Everton.\n\nAs a defender, when your keeper is letting in a lot of the shots you face - in Bravo's case, 14 of the last 22 shots on target over City's last eight games - then you lose a bit of confidence in him too.\n\nHow does Bravo's shot-save ratio compare to goalkeepers at the other top-six clubs?\n\nThe whole back-four are aware that, if you make a mistake, it will end up in a goal. You have no margin for error, and it makes people nervous.\n\nIt is the complete opposite to the confidence you feel when you have got a reliable keeper behind you, who you know can make saves that will get you out of trouble.\n\nWhat next? City will not just roll over\n\nThis City team looks like it is a work in progress for Pep, because City are nowhere near where he wants them to be.\n\nI don't think they can win the Premier League this season, but they will still be there or thereabouts in the top four. They are not just going to roll over.\n\nCity got badly beaten by Leicester in December and responded with an important win over Arsenal in their next game.\n\nThey will have to show a similar spirit, and put in an improved display, when they play Tottenham next weekend.\n\nIt is another massive game for them, but they are capable of coming back this time too.",

            "section": "Technology",
            "content": "Joyce Wheeler was one of a select group of scientists who used Edsac in their research\n\nEveryone remembers the first computer they ever used. And Joyce Wheeler is no exception. But in her case the situation was a bit different. The first computer she used was one of the first computers anyone used.\n\nThe machine was Edsac - the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator - that ran for the first time in 1949 and was built to serve scientists at the University of Cambridge.\n\nJoyce Wheeler was one of those scientists who, at the time, was working on her PhD under the supervision of renowned astronomer Fred Hoyle.\n\n\"My work was about the reactions inside stars,\" she said. \"I was particularly interested in how long main sequence stars stay on their main sequence.\n\n\"I wanted to know how long a star took to fade out,\" she explained.\n\nThe inner workings of the nuclear furnace that keep stars shining is an understandably knotty problem to solve. And, she said, the maths describing that energetic process were formidable.\n\n\"For stars, there's a rather nasty set of differential equations that describe their behaviour and composition,\" she added.\n\n\"It was not possible to be really accurate doing it by hand,\" she said. \"The errors just build up too much.\"\n\nEnter Edsac - a machine created by Prof Maurice Wilkes to do exactly the kind of calculations Ms Wheeler (nee Blackler) needed done to complete her advanced degree.\n\nFirst though, she had to learn to write the programs that would carry out the calculations.\n\nDr Wheeler started her PhD work at Cambridge in 1954 knowing about Edsac thanks to an earlier visit during which the machine had been shown off to her and others.\n\nKeen to get on with her research she sat down with the slim booklet that described how to program it and, by working through the exercises in that pioneering programming manual, learned to code.\n\nResearch students like Joyce Wheeler had to use Edsac at night\n\nThe little book was called WWG after its three authors Maurice Wilkes, David Wheeler and Stanley Gill.\n\nIt was through learning programming that Ms Blackler got talking to David Wheeler because one of her programs helped to ensure Edsac was working well. They got to know each other, fell in love and married in 1957.\n\nNow, more than 62 years on she is very matter of fact about that time - even though programmers, and especially women programmers, were rare.\n\nPerhaps because of that novel situation, a new discipline and a pioneering machine, the atmosphere at Cambridge in the computer lab was not overwhelmingly masculine.\n\n\"You could be regarded as a bit of an object, and occasionally it was a bit uncomfortable,\" she said, \"But it was not quite a boys' brigade then in the way that it became later on.\"\n\nIt was an exciting time, she said, because of what the machine could do for her and her work. She took to programming quickly, she said, her strength with maths helping her quickly master the syntax into which she had to translate those \"nasty equations\".\n\n\"But it was like maths,\" she said, \"it was one of those things that you knew you should not do for too long.\n\nThe foundations of programming were laid down by Edsac's creators\n\n\"I found I could not work at a certain programming job for more than a certain number of hours per day,\" she said. \"After that you would not make much progress.\"\n\nOften, she said, the solution to a programming problem she had been worrying away at would strike while she was engaged in something more mundane, like doing the washing or eating lunch.\n\n\"Sometimes it's better to leave something alone, to pause, and that's very true of programming.\"\n\nWith the programming done, she could let Edsac do the number crunching. As a research student she had to run her programs during the night. In her case that was Friday.\n\n\"That was good because there were no lectures the next day that you had to go to,\" she said.\n\nAs an operator she was allowed to run Edsac alone, provided she signed in and kept a record of what she did.\n\n\"Quite often it would break down during the night, but just occasionally you were lucky enough to keep it running all night,\" she said. \"If it did crash, there was little that operators were allowed to do to try to fix it.\n\n\"They didn't even let any of the cleaners get near it,\" she said.\n\nDr Wheeler had been shown one procedure that recalibrated Edsac's two kilobyte memory but if that did not help, then her work would stop for the night.\n\nDespite the regular crashes, Ms Wheeler made steady progress on finding out how long different stars would last before they collapsed.\n\nA copy of Edsac is being built at the National Museum of Computing\n\n\"I got some estimates of a star's age, how long it was going to last,\" she said. \"One of the nice things was that with programming you could repeat it. Iterate. You could not do that with a hand calculation.\n\n\"We could add in sample numbers on programs and it could easily check them,\" she added. \"I could check my results on the machine very rapidly, which was very useful.\"\n\nRapidly in the 1950s meant about 30 minutes for the machine to complete one run of a program. Then the results were printed out for researchers to pore over to see what results they had got. Then it was a case of re-programming and perhaps waiting a few days to have a chance to run a slightly modified program on Edsac.\n\nDespite the delays, it was clear to Dr Wheeler that they were pioneers.\n\n\"We were doing work that could not done in any other way,\" she said. And even though Edsac was crude and painfully slow by modern standards, she saw that a revolution had begun.\n\n\"It was clear that one day, when the machines got bigger and faster, a lot of problems would start to be solved.\"",

The Daily Telegraph claims the deal will make Mr Hunt \"the richest member of the cabinet\".\n\nJeremy Hunt set to receive a \u00a315m windfall is \"politcally embarrassing\" says the Times\n\nMeanwhile the Daily Mail's lead story highlights what it calls \"the scale of abuse of the crumbling NHS by health tourists\".\n\nIt claims a hospital in Luton is attempting to recoup \u00a3350,000 from a Nigerian woman, who is said to have flown to Britain to give birth to twins.\n\nThe cancer specialist, Professor Meirion Thomas, tells the paper that similar, \"staggering\" debts should be investigated by NHS fraud officers, as \"patients don't arrive at specialist hospitals with serious illnesses by chance\".\n\nThe Sun says the half-brother of Prince Harry's American girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has apologised after he was arrested for alleged gun offences in the US. Thomas Markle Jr blamed the incident on a drunken argument, prompting the headline \"Soz Sis! I was so sozzled\".\n\nThe Daily Mail says other members of the family have insisted the arrest will not cause problems for Ms Markle's relationship with Prince Harry, but the Daily Express claims there is \"some concern\" in royal circles.",

            "content": "China's capital is notorious for its chronic pollution. Even indoors it's a struggle to find clean air, says John Sudworth.\n\nHaving already taped most of my windows shut, I have now started on the air conditioning vents. The aim is simple - to close off every access point through which the toxic outside air leaks into our Beijing home.\n\nEven our double-glazing doesn't keep out the smog. The most dangerous constituent, particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter - or PM2.5 as it's known - finds a way through the tiniest of gaps where the windows close.\n\nSo the only solution there is duct tape.\n\nIt's like a re-enactment of a 1970s government information film on surviving a nuclear holocaust. Only it's not radiation we're trying to keep at bay, but the fallout from fossil fuels.\n\nThe most useful device in our armoury is our PM2.5 monitor. We have two, one upstairs and one downstairs, which we glance at frequently, and it was their arrival that prompted the frenzy of taping and draught-excluding that continues to this day.\n\nWhen I first arrived in China, five years ago, there was no way of monitoring the quality of air in our home. Like everyone else, we left it to blind faith that our air purifiers were doing the trick.\n\nIt now transpires they weren't. Even now on highly polluted days, we struggle to get our PM2.5 count much below 25 micrograms per cubic meter, the World Health Organization's maximum standard for safe air.\n\nAnd that's with multiple purifiers running at full tilt, large box-like machines that sit in the corner of every room - two in some - the combined noise output of which is akin to living in the engine room of an aircraft carrier.\n\nShoppers look at air purifiers in Beijing\n\nChina's air pollution problem is now so bad that its effects are measured in more than a million premature deaths a year and markedly reduced life expectancy - an average of more than five years or so - in the worst-affected regions.\n\nOver the past few weeks, a period of particularly acute and prolonged air pollution, the average air quality in Beijing has been well above 200 micrograms of PM2.5 particles per cubic metre - many times the maximum safe limit.\n\nDuring the worst of it, it's been like living under house arrest, our children confined to the small, deafening but breathable indoor space of our home for days on end.\n\nAnd across China, the smog becomes a dominant topic on social media, with the population tracking the foulness of the air via mobile phone apps.\n\nOne group of Beijing mothers, armed with their own PM2.5 counters, have even been roaming the city in search of shopping malls or cafes with filtered air - and then sharing their discoveries online.\n\nOf course, humanity's dependence on oil and coal long predate China's economic rise. But China offers a vision of environmental degradation far in excess of the pea-souper fogs of 1950s London or Manchester.\n\nFor much of the past month the cloud of toxic air hanging over this country has extended for thousands of miles, a giant, continent-sized cocktail of soot from coal fired power stations and car exhausts, smothering the lives and filling the lungs of hundreds of millions of people.\n\nWhile growing awareness means that more of them are now taking action to protect their health, many others are either not fully informed about the danger or don't have the means to do much about it.\n\nA set of new filters for a single air purifier can cost \u00a3100 ($120) or more and needs changing every six months or so.\n\nIt is, of course, not a problem only of China's making. The smartphones, computers, TV screens, jeans and shoes that have been pouring out of its factories over the past few decades are cheap, in part at least, precisely because they're made without environmental safeguards.\n\nThe interests of the rich world and an unaccountable Chinese Communist elite have neatly dovetailed. The West gets its cheap consumer desirables and China gets rich without the inconvenience of the independent scrutiny, regulation or democratic oversight of other markets.\n\nThe true cost is measured by the numbers on my pollution monitors, and it is one being borne disproportionately by ordinary Chinese people.\n\nFollowing a crackdown on a rare protest against pollution in the central city of Chengdu recently, one blogger dared to speak out in favour of the protesters. The police, he suggested, should bear in mind that the elites, whose interests they protect, have sent their families to breathe clean air overseas.\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.",

            "description": "VW has been fined $4.3bn by US authorities and agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges, so just what do documents released this week reveal about the emissions rigging scandal?",
            "section": "Business",
            "content": "US Attorney-General Loretta Lynch said VW denied and then lied in a bid to cover up its actions\n\n\"Volkswagen obfuscated, they denied, and they ultimately lied.\"\n\nThese were the words of the US Attorney General Loretta Lynch, as she set out how the German carmaker would be punished for attempting to hoodwink the US authorities over the emissions produced by its diesel cars.\n\nIt has been a tough week for Volkswagen.\n\nIt has been fined $4.3bn, agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges - and six executives are facing charges. One of them, Oliver Schmidt, has spent the past few days in a Miami jail. Others may yet find themselves in the firing line.\n\nBut because of this, we now have a very clear idea not only of what Volkswagen was doing wrong, and how it went about it, but also the measures that were taken to conceal that wrongdoing.\n\nAs part of its plea bargain with the US authorities Volkswagen signed up to an agreed \"Statement of Facts\". It draws heavily on the results of an investigation by the law firm Jones Day, commissioned by VW itself.\n\nThe FBI makes further detailed allegations in its criminal complaint against Oliver Schmidt. These have not yet been tested or admitted.\n\nAccording to these documents, the seeds of the scandal were sown in 2006, when VW were designing a new diesel engine for the US market.\n\nSupervisors in the engine department realised they had a problem. They could not design an engine that would meet tough emissions standards due to enter into force in 2007, and at the same time give customers the performance that they wanted.\n\nTheir solution was to ask their engineers to design engine management software which would turn on emissions controls when the car was being tested, and turn them off when it was being driven on the road.\n\nThis 'defeat device' software was able to recognise the standard testing procedure. It was based on a program developed by VW's subsidiary Audi, which engineers had specifically stated should \"absolutely not be used\" in the US.\n\nNot everyone was happy about this, it seems. Engineers \"raised objections to the propriety of the defeat device\" in late 2006.\n\nIn response, a manager decided that production should continue, still using the device. He also \"instructed those in attendance, in sum and substance, not to get caught\".\n\nA similar row broke out the following year, and again, the decision was taken to press on regardless.\n\nSubsequently, the use of the defeat device appears to have become routine.\n\nThe Statement of Facts describes how the software was refined and improved over time.\n\nA spate of breakdowns was blamed on the cars remaining in 'test' mode while being driven on the road. Supervisors worked with engineers to solve the problem, and \"encouraged the further concealment of the software\".\n\nThe engineers were also told to destroy documents relating to the issue.\n\nThe deception came to a head when, in 2014, the California Air Resources Board approached the company to find out why tests had shown that its cars were emitting up to 40 times the permissible amount of nitrogen oxides when driven on the road.\n\nVW supervisors \"determined not to disclose to US regulators that the tested vehicle models operated with a defeat device\". Instead they \"decided to pursue a strategy of concealing the defeat device\u2026 while appearing to cooperate\".\n\nThe FBI claims in its criminal complaint against Mr Schmidt - who was a head of compliance at VW's US division from 2012 to 2015 - that the deception eventually went to the very top of the company.\n\nCiting \"co-operative witnesses\" and allegedly corroborating documentation, it claims that the company's executive management in Wolfsburg were briefed on the issue in July 2015. Rather than tell its staff to come clean about the defeat device, it says, \"VW executive management authorized its continued concealment\".\n\nThere is, however, no mention of this meeting in the statement agreed by Volkswagen.\n\nUltimately, Volkswagen's wrongdoing was confirmed to the authorities by a single employee acting \"in direct contravention of instructions from supervisors at VW\". But the deception did not end there.\n\nThe Statement of Facts explains how VW staff were warned by an in-house lawyer that the authorities were about to circulate a so-called \"hold notice\", obliging them to retain and preserve documents under their control.\n\nEngineers were told to \"check their documents\", which several of those present \"understood to mean that they should delete their documents\".\n\nThe message was repeated at a number of subsequent meetings, one of them attended by 30-40 people and ultimately thousands of documents were deleted.\n\nWhen the scandal at Volkswagen first came to light, the company's former US chief executive, Michael Horn blamed \"a couple of software engineers\". It is now clear that many more people were involved, at least some of them in positions of authority, and deliberate attempts were made to cover up wrongdoing.\n\nIt is not hard, then, to see why the US authorities have taken such a tough line with the company. But some questions remain unanswered.\n\nWe still don't know for certain, for example, whether people at board level knew what was going on.\n\nIt's also unclear why the same software that was fitted illegally to 600,000 US vehicles was also present on millions of others sold around the world, including eight million in Europe.\n\nVW continues to maintain that the systems didn't actually break European law - though it is in the process of repairing those vehicles all the same.",

            "description": "Who is behind the persona that US spy chiefs say is at the heart of the Russian hacking allegations?",
            "section": "BBC Trending",
            "content": "US intelligence agencies dispute that Guccifer 2.0 is just one individual\n\nWho or what is Guccifer 2.0? US intelligence agencies believe the mysterious hacker persona was central to efforts to interfere with last year's American election and responsible for distributing hacked documents that embarrassed the Democratic Party. But now Guccifer 2.0 has broken a two-month silence to deny any connection to Russia. In the run up to Donald Trump's victory, BBC Trending's Mike Wendling struck up an online dialogue with Guccifer 2.0 to try to probe the hacker's motives.\n\nIt turned out that talking to one of the world's most notorious hackers was easier than you might think. Just send him a tweet.\n\nIn the summer of 2016 the hacker, going by the name Guccifer 2.0, leaked a trove of documents from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to Wikileaks, which then made the material public.\n\nThe revelations were embarrassing for the Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign, and resulted in the resignation of party chair Debbie Wasserman-Shultz.\n\nAlthough Guccifer 2.0 took his name from a Romanian hacker - the original Guccifer hacked emails belonging to American and Romanian officials, and is currently in prison - suspicion immediately fell on Russia.\n\nMetadata attached to the leaked documents was in Russian not Romanian. Analysts determined that Guccifer 2.0 had used a Russian server. A host of security experts traced the leak to Russian intelligence.\n\nLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, a journalist with Vice's Motherboard, chatted with the hacker in Romanian in the days after the DNC hack. The problem was, Guccifer didn't seem to speak the language very well.\n\n\"He did answer some questions in Romanian,\" but the answers were very basic, Franceschi-Bicchierai told BBC Trending.\n\n\"I showed those answers to people who did speak Romanian and they all agreed he wasn't a Romanian speaker,\" Franceschi-Bicchierai says. \"We later put the conversation to linguists and not everyone agreed that he was a Russian speaker but he was definitely not a native Romanian speaker.\"\n\nListen to more on this story on BBC Trending radio on the BBC World Service.\n\nDuring our exchanges in October - and until the present day - Guccifer 2.0 continued to deny having anything to do with Russia.\n\nHe also claimed to have more incriminating documents on Hillary Clinton - documents which he urged me to publish.\n\nThe information was sent to me via encrypted email. But despite the cloak-and-dagger presentation, the material was ultimately disappointing - a mishmash of old stories, publically available documents which were rather dull, and others which were obvious forgeries.\n\nI asked him about his motivations. He said he believed that people have the right to know what's going on in the election process.\n\nTrying to get friendly journalists to write sympathetic stories is a common tactic of Russia's online intelligence operations, says Lee Foster of FireEye, one of the big computer security firms which has been looking into the Guccifer 2.0 hacks.\n\n\"This is actually something that we've coined 'direct advocacy',\" Foster says. \"These false hactivists reach out to journalists but also other individuals, security blogs, and so on to get them to publicise the activity that they've been engaged in and sometimes even to spin particular narratives around those leaks as well.\"\n\nFoster says he's highly confident that the Russian authorities are behind the Guccifer persona. For its part, Moscow denies being behind the leaks, and Julian Assange of Wikileaks says Russia wasn't the source of the leaked DNC emails.\n\nAfter that, he stopped responding to my messages.\n\nIn the run-up to the US election in November, Guccifer warned that the Democrats would attempt to rig the vote. But after Donald Trump's victory, he went silent.\n\nLast week US intelligence chiefs released a declassified version of a report which has been presented to President Obama and President-Elect Trump.\n\nOne of the report's key judgements read: \"We assess with high confidence that Russian military intelligence (General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate or GRU) used the Guccifer 2.0 persona and DCLeaks.com to release US victim data obtained in cyber operations publicly and in exclusives to media outlets and relayed material to WikiLeaks.\"\n\nIt added: \"Guccifer 2.0, who claimed to be an independent Romanian hacker, made multiple contradictory statements and false claims about his likely Russian identity throughout the election. Press reporting suggests more than one person claiming to be Guccifer 2.0 interacted with journalists.\"\n\nSo could there be several people involved in operating the Guccifer 2.0 persona? Lee Foster from FireEye believes so.\n\n\"It may be one person who actually looks after the twitter account or it may be part of a team,\" he told Trending. \"But what we certainly can say based on the scale of the activity that we're seeing - that encompasses everything from this initial breach all the way through to the creation of these fake personas to push the information through to the trolling activity trying to push narratives around these leaks - this is not a one person effort. There's quite clearly a concerted and very well resourced and frankly sophisticated operation that is making all of this stuff come together.\"\n\nLate on Thursday, Guccifer broke his two-month silence to respond to the US intelligence agencies report. \"Here I am again, my friends!\" he announced on his blog.\n\n\"I'd like to make it clear enough that these accusations are unfounded,\" the hacker wrote. \"I have totally no relation to the Russian government. I'd like to tell you once again I was acting in accordance with my personal political views and beliefs.\"\n\nSeveral observers noted that Guccifer's English had markedly improved.\n\nDonald Trump has promised a full report on hacking within 90 days of taking office.\n\nLee Foster from FireEye says we shouldn't get too hung up on the Guccifer 2.0 brand.\n\n\"What doesn't really matter here is the personas themselves. What matters is to what extent does type of activity continue and potentially expand as well. We're already on the trolling side seeing a redirection towards European elections coming up, particularly France and Germany in 2017,\" he says.\n\nAfter the report, and his blog re-emergence, I tried once more to contact Guccifer 2.0 on Twitter.\n\nNext story: 'Why I dropped the case against the man who groped me'\n\nSamya Gupta, a 21-year-old law student from the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, was napping on a seat near the back of a bus when she felt something on her breasts.

            "authors": [],
            "description": "Andy Murray and Johanna Konta could both win the Australian Open, but the British supporting cast is not here to make up the numbers.",
            "section": null,
            "content": "Coverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra plus TV highlights on BBC Two from 21 Jan; live text on selected matches on BBC Sport website.\n\nAndy Murray says it feels no different to enter the Australian Open as the world number one. A few players do now address him as 'Sir' - but that, he says, is with tongue firmly in cheek.\n\nThe challenge, though, remains as tough as ever. Murray has lost five finals in Melbourne in the past seven years, while Novak Djokovic - now the number two - has won the title six times in all.\n\nMurray struck an important blow by beating his lifelong rival at the World Tour Finals to end 2016 at the top of the rankings; but earlier this month, the Serb hit back to win the Qatar Open in Doha and halt Murray's winning streak at 28 in a match of nearly three hours.\n\nMurray is expecting another gruelling clash should they meet in the final here in Melbourne on 29 January.\n\n\"The way that we both play, we can't just hit through each other in one shot,\" the Scot said.\n\u2022 None How to follow the Australian Open on the BBC\n\n\"It takes a few big shots to win points, so if we're playing well they tend to be long, physical matches.\n\n\"Doha was good because I was able to see how well I recovered from it: first week of the year, you can be a bit stiff and sore. I pulled up pretty well, so it was positive.\"\n\nMuch may depend on the energy they expend in the early rounds of the competition. The draw does not appear to leave either at a significant advantage, so at 29, Murray has as good a chance as ever of winning his first Australian Open title.\n\nIn the women's draw, there is a real opportunity for a top-20 player without a Grand Slam title to break their duck at this Australian Open. Britain's Johanna Konta is as well equipped as any.\n\nThe 25-year-old, who will be ninth in Monday's world rankings, is on a high after winning her second WTA title in Sydney on Friday, but it does mean she has had little time to rest before a challenging first week.\n\nHer draw appears brutal (although she will not thank you for telling her, as she prefers not to look beyond the first match).\n\nIf Konta can beat 2013 Wimbledon semi-finalist Kirsten Flipkens of Belgium in the first round, she might then have to face the aggressive talent of Japanese 19-year-old Naomi Osaka in the second round and former world number one Caroline Wozniacki in the third.\n\nKonta's decision at the end of last season to part company with coach Esteban Carril, so soon after the sudden death of her mental coach Juan Coto, was a big surprise.\n\nThe WTA's most improved player of 2016 was 150 in the world when she started working with Carril, but my understanding is the two were unable to agree financial terms for the year ahead.\n\nIt is a sign of Konta's standing in the game that she has been able to attract one of the best in the business as a replacement. Wim Fissette is just 36 - but already has a sparkling CV.\n\nThe Belgian was coach to Kim Clijsters when she won three of her Grand Slam titles, and has also coached Sabine Lisicki and Simona Halep to Grand Slam finals. A flourishing partnership with Victoria Azarenka only ended when the Belarusian announced she was taking a break from the sport because she was pregnant.\n\nKonta and Fissette agreed to work together after a trial week at Patrick Mouratoglou's Academy in Nice in the week before Christmas. Mouratoglou, the coach of Serena Williams, rates Fissette highly.\n\n\"He's worked with some of the best players on tour so he has the experience and I think he's still fresh,\" he said.\n\n\"He's young, so he still has the motivation which is something very important because when you get older, a lot of guys don't want to travel that much. He's one of the best on tour, so I think it's a good pick.\"\n\nSupporting cast no longer just make up the numbers\n\nAt last year's US Open, Dan Evans made the third round, and fellow Briton Kyle Edmund the fourth.\n\nEdmund, 22, is now a top-50 player, and Evans just a single place adrift after he appeared in his maiden ATP final in Sydney on Saturday.\n\nEvans' creative talents have long been on show, but his consistency is now far greater and even in the defeat by Luxembourg's Gilles Muller the 5ft 9in player showed his serve can still pack a punch.\n\nAll of the 26-year-old's matches bar the final in Sydney went to three sets, so sustaining his form in the opening week in Melbourne will be tough - especially with a Monday start.\n\nEvans, who faces Argentina's Facundo Bagnis in the first round, says it is positive that the matches are coming thick and fast and he was grateful for the private jet laid on by Tennis Australia for the journey to Melbourne on Saturday night.\n\nEdmund, meanwhile, has developed the useful knack of halving his world ranking on an annual basis. Every year, the challenge gets tougher, but he now stands at 46 in the world and in Brisbane earlier this month featured in his fifth ATP quarter-final since the start of last year.\n\nHis forehand is one of the most powerful in the world, his net game much improved, and the physical problems which have undermined him in five-set matches hopefully now a thing of the past.\n\nCramp proved his undoing in the first round of last year's Australian Open, and Edmund will once again have to deal with temperatures in the mid-30s Celsius for his first-round match against Colombia's Santiago Giraldo on Tuesday.\n\nIt was not a year to remember in 2016 for Aljaz Bedene, who nearly decided to walk away from the sport last summer. His love of tennis deserted him - something he relates directly to the International Tennis Federation's rejection of his appeal against his ineligibility to play Davis Cup for Great Britain.\n\n\"I honestly didn't want to play tennis, I didn't want to think about tennis,\" Slovenian-born Bedene, 27, said.\n\nWith his love of the game seemingly restored, Bedene faces Victor Estrella Burgos in the opening round. There is no finer example of the perils of retiring too young than the man from the Dominican Republic, who cracked the top 100 for the first time at the age of 33.\n\nWatson and Broady hope to upset their hosts\n\nThe other two British players in the draw face seeded Australians in the opening round.\n\nHeather Watson, 24, has fallen to 75 in the world after a promising start to last year, but will be in the Margaret Court Arena for her match against Sam Stosur.\n\nAustralia's highest women's seed is the 2011 US Open champion, but has a poor record in Melbourne where in 15 years she has reached the fourth round just twice.\n\nNaomi Broady, 26, takes on an Australian who made a name for herself here last year. Daria Gavrilova beat two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova en route to the fourth round in the first Australian Open she had contested since switching nationalities from Russia.\n\nBroady, at 95 in the world, is competing in her first main draw in Melbourne and can never be discounted given the potency of her serve.\n\nThe one high profile name missing from the main draw is Laura Robson, whose defeat in the first round of qualifying was her seventh in a row. In truth, it was a hugely erratic performance undermined by a chronic loss of confidence.\n\nRobson is still only 22, though, and working seriously for the first time with a sports psychologist. A run of Challenger tournaments in France and Germany will provide a better clue to what 2017 holds in store - and whether she will be part of the debate once the French Open rolls around in four months' time.",

She faded into obscurity - but her great-grandson, who created Downton Abbey, has put her back in the spotlight.\n\nWhen 17-year-old Ivy Close charmed the country in the first nationwide beauty competition, the press swooned over her \"exquisite loveliness\".\n\nPart of her prize - along with a new Rover motorcar - was to have her portrait exhibited at the Royal Academy in London.\n\nThat picture, showing Close with rosy cheeks and wispy curls, also took up the entire front page of the Daily Mirror - which had run the contest - on 4 May 1908.\n\nIvy Close beat 15,000 other entrants to win the Daily Mirror's beauty contest\n\n\"She's effectively the first British beauty queen,\" says her great-grandson Gareth Neame, a Bafta-winning TV producer who came up with the concept for Downton and made The Hollow Crown and Hotel Babylon.\n\n\"And there was then a competition between the winner in Britain and the winner in the US, and she ended up winning that one. So I often say she was effectively the first ever Miss World.\"\n\nThe portrait, by Sir Arthur Hacker, has now been restored thanks to a donation from Mr Neame and is hanging in the refurbished Ferens Art Gallery in Hull, which reopened on Friday to coincide with Hull becoming UK City of Culture.\n\nIt is a return to the limelight for one of Britain's first modern celebrities, whose career took the firework trajectory that has been followed by many celebrities over the decades since.\n\nBorn in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, Close beat 15,000 other hopefuls to the beauty contest title, which was awarded by nine famous artists on the Daily Mirror's Beauty Adjudication Committee (yes, really).\n\nShe became an instant star and there was \"an overwhelming rush for copies\" of a special commemorative edition of the paper that featured Close in \"a variety of charming poses\".\n\nThe portrait now has a prominent spot in Hull's Ferens gallery\n\nJust as she charmed the Beauty Adjudication Committee, Close also caught the eye of society photographer Elwin Neame, who had photographed the finalists.\n\nTwo years later, her picture filled the Daily Mirror front page again - this time in her wedding dress.\n\nInside, the paper reported how a large crowd had gathered outside the church where she had married Elwin Neame, and how she had been accompanied by a \"best girl\", as opposed to a best man.\n\nIn her film debut two years later, directed by her husband and filmed in their house, she played a model posing as figures from famous paintings.\n\nShe went on to star in a long list of films that decade and set up her own production company, which was not uncommon for a successful actress in the silent era.\n\nGareth Neame (right) with Downton Abbey writer Julian Fellowes and actress Elizabeth McGovern\n\n\"It's a well-trodden path, to have gone from being a model to an actress, and she went to America to be in the movies before Hollywood was even invented,\" Gareth Neame explains.\n\n\"She went to America in about 1917 and went to Jacksonville in Florida, which was one of the centres of film-making back then, and she was in a company of actors along with Oliver Hardy.\"\n\nAfter that, Close's films included the 1923 French epic La Roue, of which Jean Cocteau said: \"There is cinema before and after La Roue, as there is painting before and after Picasso.\"\n\nGareth Neame says: \"I've got it on DVD so I'm able to watch my great-grandmother as a young woman as the lead in a silent movie. She was a reputable actress with some career.\"\n\nBut her life took a tragic turn the same year when Elwin Neame was killed in a motorcycle accident. \"It must have been quite a tough life, having lost her husband so young,\" Gareth Neame says.\n\n\"My grandfather [Ronald] was at boarding school, but just one year in, at the age of 14, he had to be pulled out because there wasn't the money to pay the fees any more.\"\n\nGareth Neame is the son of Christopher Neame (left) and grandson of Ronald Neame (centre)\n\nMeanwhile, with the arrival of talking movies, Close's acting roles were drying up. \"Like the film The Artist, about the end of the silent film era, I think she was one of the people that fell foul of that.\n\n\"I'm not sure her accent quite fitted in with American audiences, and when talking pictures came in, that was really the end of her career.\"\n\nShe did pantomime and minor films, but had fallen off the radar by the end of the 1920s. If there was a Celebrity Big Brother in 1931, she would surely have done it.\n\nGareth Neame was a toddler when Close died in 1968. \"I never knew the lady, but she was quite a big figure in the family by all accounts.\n\n\"Like a lot of people in showbusiness, as she got older she was probably slightly curmudgeonly and thought 'it's not the way that it used to be'.\n\n\"It must have been very interesting to have been this very beautiful young starlet and very famous, and then talking pictures come along and your career starts to fade.\"\n\nHer career may have faded, but the family dynasty she and Elwin Neame launched is still going strong.\n\nRonald Neame went into the family business, and went on to direct The Poseidon Adventure and The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (with an Oscar-winning turn by future Downton Abbey star Dame Maggie Smith) and co-write Brief Encounter.\n\nRonald's son Christopher Neame was a Bafta-nominated writer and producer, meaning Gareth is the fourth generation to have success in the TV and film industries.\n\nHis father and grandfather knew about the portrait of Ivy Close, but did not know where it had ended up after being shown at the Royal Academy.\n\nAn online art database, ArtUK, meant Gareth Neame could track it down easily. He got in touch with the Ferens curator, who told him it had not been exhibited for several years because it needed restoration - and pointed him in the direction of their Adopt A Painting scheme.\n\n\"It's very nice to be able to make a charitable gift for something that brings back a piece of art into public view, and because of my family association with it,\" he says.\n\nBut restoring the painting is not the only way he has kept her memory alive. \"I put a little reference to her when we made Downton Abbey,\" he reveals.\n\n\"We had a scene where a couple of the servants went to the pictures and they were coming back from having seen a film that Ivy Close was in. It was a little in-joke for me.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
