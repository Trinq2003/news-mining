            "section": null,
            "content": "Bernie Ecclestone stands a little under 5ft 3in tall but for 40 years has wielded a giant influence in Formula 1 with canniness, wit and not a little menace.\n\nAt times, Ecclestone has had close to absolute power. So the end of his reign following the takeover of the sport by US giant Liberty Media represents a seismic change.\n\nEcclestone, now 86, is a tactician of remarkable skill, and a deal-maker extraordinaire who used chutzpah and brinksmanship to turn F1 into one of the world's biggest sports, form relationships with world leaders such as Russian president Vladimir Putin and make himself and many of F1's participants multi-millionaires.\n\nIn a remarkable four decades, Ecclestone revolutionised the sport:\n\u2022 None He bought the Brabham team and won two world titles, including a historic first with a turbo engine in 1983.\n\u2022 None Turned F1 into the biggest annual sporting event in the world, outstripped only by the Olympics and the World Cup.\n\u2022 None Controversially took the commercial rights away from the teams and made himself a billionaire.\n\u2022 None Fought off a criminal prosecution for blackmail that arose from a complicated series of sales of those rights.\n\u2022 None Carved a notorious reputation for making controversial statements, including saying Adolf Hitler was \"able to get things done\" and likening women to \"domestic appliances\".\n\nBut what made him mind-bendingly - some would say obscenely - rich is what brought him down in the end.\n\nSelling on the commercial rights to F1 is the source of Ecclestone's vast wealth. But it was never about the money, per se - it was about the deal. And now the deal has done him in.\n\nRestructuring the finances of the sport in the first years of this decade, Ecclestone also reorganised its decision-making process.\n\nHe did it to increase his power, but the structure he set up inadvertently neutered him and gave the big teams - particularly Mercedes and Ferrari - power to block him. This has led to log-jam.\n\nThe latest company to buy the sport - USA's Liberty Media - has looked at this, at a skewed prize-money structure, at a policy that is threatening to price out much-loved historic races in favour of characterless new ones in countries with questionable regimes, at a refusal to engage with digital media, and several other issues, and decided to ease him out.\n\nEcclestone is held in genuinely high regard within F1 for everything he has achieved but, outside a handful of acolytes, few will be genuinely sorry to see him go.\n\nThere has been a feeling for some years that he is a man out of time, that the sport needed to move on. In truth, this has contributed to the stalemate in F1 - people were simply waiting him out.\n\nMany believe his departure will be good for the sport. However, it will certainly make F1 less colourful, and it is hard to imagine seeing the like of him again.\n\nWhere did he come from?\n\nEcclestone's involvement in F1 started in the late 1950s. After a brief driving career in lower categories, he emerged as a manager for the British F1 driver Stuart Lewis-Evans but then disappeared from racing when Lewis-Evans was killed in a fiery crash at the 1958 Moroccan Grand Prix.\n\nHe appeared again in the late 1960s, again as a manager, this time to the Austrian Jochen Rindt. He was already very rich.\n\nWhat had the fortune come from? \"Property,\" Ecclestone says. All manner of rumours have abounded, including that he was involved in organising the Great Train Robbery, when \u00a32.6m was stolen from a Royal Mail train in Buckinghamshire in 1963.\n\n\"Nah,\" Ecclestone once said. \"There wasn't enough money on that train. I could have done something better than that.\"\n\nRindt became F1's first and so far only posthumous world champion after he was killed at the 1970 Italian Grand Prix. But this time Ecclestone did not retreat.\n\nWithin a couple of years, he bought Brabham from its founder, the three-time world champion Sir Jack Brabham, and began establishing his power base.\n\nHow did he become omnipotent?\n\nBack then, circuit deals and television rights were operated on a somewhat haphazard, piecemeal basis. Ecclestone offered to look after them on the teams' behalf and wasted little time in building his influence.\n\nHe persuaded television companies to buy F1 as a package, rather than pay for individual races. That guaranteed vastly increased exposure, and the sport's popularity grew increasingly quickly.\n\nThe vast growth of F1 from what it was then to what it is today arguably started in earnest after the 1976 season, when a championship battle between the playboy Englishman James Hunt and the ascetic Austrian Niki Lauda caught the public's imagination.\n\nBy the 1980s, F1 was becoming a global sport, more and more races were being shown live, and a generation of charismatic stars enhanced its appeal - Alain Prost, Nigel Mansell, Nelson Piquet and, most of all, Ayrton Senna.\n\nIronically, Senna's death in 1994 only increased its reach and shortly after that the sport started on the route that has led to Ecclestone's departure.\n\nThe beginning of the end\n\nControversially, in the mid-1990s, Ecclestone struck a deal with his long-time friend and ally Max Mosley, who was then the president of governing body the FIA. It saw his own company become the rights holder of F1, taking over from the teams' collective body that Ecclestone previously ran.\n\nThis led to a furious row with some of the teams - particularly McLaren, Williams and Tyrrell - who claimed what Ecclestone was doing was illegal and that he was effectively robbing them.\n\nBut the complainants were eventually bought off. Ecclestone then set about monetising his new asset.\n\nIn 2000, Mosley granted Ecclestone the commercial rights to F1 until the end of 2110 for a one-off fee of $360m. Even then, many were shocked by the relatively paltry amount of money that changed hands to secure such a lucrative and lengthy deal.\n\nThis led to a dizzying series of sales as the rights transferred through various institutions. A German cable TV company bought them, and then collapsed, which led to its creditors - banks - taking its assets. In 2006, the German bank BayernLB sold its 47.2% stake in F1 to an investment company called CVC Capital Partners.\n\nCVC ran the sport for 10 years, employing Ecclestone as chief executive and empowering him to carry on as before, before selling to Liberty last September, in the deal completed on Monday.\n\nBut the sale from BayernLB to CVC is what ultimately led to the court cases on bribery charges that Ecclestone fought and survived a couple of years ago - and which he ended by paying the German courts $100m to end the case, without a presumption of guilt or innocence.\n\nIt did not escape notice that a man charged with bribery had paid - perfectly legally under German law - to end a criminal trial.\n\nWhat is he like?\n\nDespite his diminutive stature, Ecclestone is a forbidding character. Stories abound in F1 of real and threatened menace.\n\nA conversation with him is akin to juggling sand - he ducks and dodges and avoids questions with obfuscation, distraction and quick wit, a dizzying mix of truths, half-truths and fallacies.\n\nHe is approachable but apart, engaging but unknowable. After a verbal sparring match, he will sometimes reach up and chillingly pat you on the cheek, not unlike a mafia don in the movies.\n\nFor years, the more unsavoury aspects of Ecclestone's stewardship were glossed over or laughed off - largely because he was making those he was working for so much money.\n\nBut in recent years, the tone in F1 has changed as more and more people began to feel he was past his sell-by date.\n\nHe was a reluctant embracer of the internet age, and rejected entreaties to try to use it to extend F1's reach.\n\nHis argument was that he saw no way to make money out of it; others argued that his modus operandi of pursuing only the deal, the bottom line, and disregarding its potential longer-term effects was doing more harm than good.\n\nHis simple model - sell television rights and races to the highest bidder no matter who it was; squeeze the highest price possible out of continuing partners - created an annual global revenue in the region of $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn).\n\nYet he became increasingly haphazard and intransigent in his decision-making, coming up with unpopular ideas such as a double-points finale in 2014 or the fiasco over the change to the qualifying format at the start of 2016 - to try to spice up the sport.\n\nHe was responding to declining audiences, but seemed to ignore the fact they were dropping largely because of his switch away from free-to-air towards pay television in key markets, and the questionable effect on the racing of gimmicks such as the DRS overtaking aid and tyres on which drivers could not push flat out.\n\nThe declining audiences have led to a crisis of confidence within the sport, the response to which is a new set of rules for 2017 that mean faster, more dramatic-looking cars. But already there are concerns that these may not have the desired effect.\n\nBut while the problems are real, the fact remains that F1 has just changed hands in a deal that values it at $8bn (\u00a36.4bn).\n\nAnd that is almost entirely down to Ecclestone and what he has built with his remarkable personality, vision and drive.\n\nControversial he certainly was; past his best he may have been. But for all his faults, Bernie Ecclestone is a unique and titanic figure who turned what was essentially a niche activity into a glittering global enterprise that to many represents an intoxicating mix of glamour, danger and raw, unmatched drama.\n\nGone from power he may be, but he will never be forgotten.",

            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Boxing\n\nCoverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live, plus live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and BBC Sport app\n\nRecently Carl Frampton joked that when he had Julius Caesar's words tattooed on his chest at 18-years-old, he hadn't achieved much. How times have changed.\n\nAs he approaches his 30th birthday, the Belfast man is already a history maker, a role model, and one of the best pound-for-pound boxers in the world.\n\nHe won almost every individual award in the sport for his performances in 2016. Ring Magazine, ESPN and USA Today were just some of the bodies that named him fighter of the year.\n\nFrampton upsets the odds in New York\n\nFrampton and his manager Barry McGuigan have always said: \"To make it in boxing, you need to make it in America.\"\n\nBefore his July showdown with Leo Santa Cruz, nearly every US boxing pundit backed the Mexican to continue his undefeated career.\n\nHowever, it was the Belfast fighter who left with the WBA world featherweight title having almost certainly booked his spot in the sport's Hall of Fame following a stunning victory.\n\nTwo rounds in, after Frampton had almost knocked down Santa Cruz with a clubbing blow, a group of the American reporters turned round to me ringside, and screamed: \"Who the hell is this kid? He is the real deal.\"\n\nThey were marvelling at his performance against a three-weight world champion, who is a big star Stateside.\n\nThe USA had fallen in love with Carl Frampton. It is easy to see why.\n\nIn politics and public office, analysts refer to the \"likeability factor\". Some have it, some don't. Frampton simply oozes it.\n\nIt hasn't been sculpted, or manufactured. He is one of the most genuine, decent, honest and grounded sportsmen I have ever met.\n\nHe is a proud Belfast boy who has fanatical supporters willing to travel anywhere to watch him fight.\n\nThe day after his victory over Santa Cruz, he booked out a Manhattan bar and invited all his fans, by way of saying thank you.\n\nIt was an incredibly classy move from the 29-year-old, as he was intending to hold the event regardless of how he fared the previous night.\n\nHe didn't have to do it, but wanted to give fans an opportunity to chat with him, get something signed, or take a selfie.\n\nIt wasn't a PR stunt, it was Carl being Carl, pint in hand, having the craic and taking time to chat to each and every person.\n\nThe supporters appreciated it - a free drink is always nice - but after many of them had shelled out a lot of money to head to the Big Apple, getting an opportunity to chat with the main man was the icing on the cake following an unforgettable weekend.\n\nFast forward a few months, and Santa Cruz wants revenge. He says that he may even consider quitting boxing should he lose the rematch on Saturday at the MGM Grand.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a career-defining fight for the Californian-based Mexican. But the same can be said about Frampton.\n\nHe is entering the last three or four years of his career and wants to make the most of them.\n\nFrampton doesn't want to ride off into the sunset. He wants to go out swinging.\n\nHis legacy, that's what it is all about now. He wants every fight to be a big fight. No messing about.\n\nHe isn't a man to look too far ahead, but he feels like a new man at featherweight - stronger, more powerful, capable of anything - something that his sparring partners would back up.\n\nHe has history in his sights. Becoming Ireland's first three-weight world champion is achievable.\n\nBeating Santa Cruz could set up a summer showdown at Windsor Park against Welshman Lee Selby and the chance to unify two divisions in under two years.\n\nFrampton joins champions who have fought in Vegas\n\nSanta Cruz will want to quash that dream, or at least stall it.\n\nThe two fighters are family men, fathers and husbands first, boxers second. Their perspective on life is refreshing in high-end sport, as is their respect for each others' abilities.\n\nThere is no need to trash talk, or disrespect one another; this fight sells itself.\n\nThe MGM in Vegas has hosted some of the biggest bouts in the sports history, and this has all the makings of a classic. All great sportsmen need a rival and, as Frampton says, maybe Santa Cruz will be his \"dance partner\".\n\nPeople of a certain generation know where they were when McGuigan defeated Eusebio Pedroza in 1985. It was an iconic moment watched by 20 million people, while half of Ireland claims to have been at Loftus Road.\n\nIn years to come, will 28 January 2017 become just as memorable?\n\nIf so, the Belfast fighter really will have conquered the boxing world and lived up to that teenage tattoo.",

            "content": "Most of the papers lead on the fall-out from the government's Brexit court defeat\n\nThe Brexit Supreme Court ruling makes the lead for nearly all the papers, but one of the most eye-catching headlines can be found in the inside pages of the Daily Mail.\n\n\"Champions of the People\", it proclaims, praising the three justices who found themselves in the minority as they sided with the government in the case.\n\nThe Mail attracted controversy in November when it branded three High Court judges \"enemies of the people\" for ruling Parliament had to be consulted over Brexit.\n\nThe Mail thinks it is not good for democracy that this decision has been now backed by the Supreme Court, arguing this, in effect, turns the EU referendum into a \"mere opinion poll\".\n\nThe Guardian is pleased with the Supreme Court judgement, saying it upheld a major constitutional principle in the face of what it describes as \"shameful attacks\" by the Brexit press.\n\nIt think the government should now publish a formal White Paper on its goals for Brexit.\n\nBut the Financial Times warns MPs against trying to micro-manage the negotiations.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph says Parliament has a duty to act responsibly and not seek a re-run of the referendum campaign.\n\n\"What's not to like when British judges in Britain's Supreme Court rule that British law makes the British Parliament sovereign,\" is the Daily Mirror take on Tuesday's Brexit ruling.\n\nBut it is not an opinion that is shared by all the leader writers.\n\nThe Times warns the Lords against trying to frustrate Brexit.\n\nIt would do so at its peril, says the paper, adding: \"Showdowns between the two houses rarely end well for the Lords and the country does not need yet another constitutional headache.\"\n\nThe Daily Telegraph says that ministers are privately warning the government is prepared to flood the Lords with hundreds of Conservative peers if it obstructs the process of leaving the EU.\n\nThe Daily Mail believes new recruits are being discouraged from joining the Army because of historical inquiries into soldiers who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIt says the Army remains 4% below its required strength, the nearly 7,000 cadets who signed up in the past year being about 3,000 short of the target.\n\nA group campaigning to end the investigations tells the Mail that the figures are no surprise, asking why anyone would want to join the forces when they could be hounded for years.\n\nThe Financial Times thinks the world ought to start taking seriously US President Donald Trump's threat to impose trade tariffs in order to protect American goods.\n\nIn an editorial it argues that many still assume he is bluffing in order to win better deals.\n\nBut, it says, the first few days of his presidency have shown that he is not posturing and he thinks protectionism will make America richer.\n\nThe FT wonders how far he will get before he and his country both discover just how wrong he is.\n\nThe reported Trident missile failure may have made the headlines in recent days, but the Times reminds us that problems involving nuclear submarines are not new.\n\nIt reports on a CIA document which has revealed that a Soviet submarine and an American one, which was carrying a 160 nuclear warheads, crashed into each other in 1974 near Holy Loch, about 30 miles from Glasgow.\n\nOne expert says the crash was so serious there was a danger that the crews could have tried to defend themselves - believing they were under attack - leading to the possibility of war.\n\nThe growing number of homes with wood-burning stoves is partly being blamed for worsening air pollution levels in London, according to the Daily Telegraph.\n\nAir quality readings in some parts of the capital were worse this week than in Beijing.\n\nThe weather and traffic pollution have led to the alert but, according to experts at King's College, wood fires were also responsible with more than a million homes now having the stoves.\n\nDavid Cameron explains in the Times why he is becoming the president of Alzheimer's Research UK\n\nOn its front page, the Daily Mirror again has photos of drivers clutching their mobiles while out on the road.\n\nFour months after the paper began its campaign to change public attitudes, it asks, \"When will we ever learn?\"\n\nA traffic officer tells the paper he has heard every excuse in the book from the drivers he has pulled over.\n\nHe says one builder tried to throw his phone out the window when he was caught, while another woman insisted she did not own one, until it went off under the seat where she had hidden it.\n\nThe Mirror says cars and vans are deadly weapons in the hands of what it calls \"mobile phone morons\" and calls for more of them to be banned.\n\nIn the Times, David Cameron explains why he is becoming the president of Alzheimer's Research UK.\n\nHe says there needs to be a deeper understanding of the disease so that dementia is not accepted as inevitable in later life.\n\nThe paper says the article represents his \"first important political intervention since leaving Downing Street\".\n\nIt thinks Mr Cameron is concerned that Theresa May could downgrade funding for dementia research which for him was a \"personal priority.\"",

He's played by Casey Affleck, in a clenched and riveting performance which fulfils all the promise he's ever shown, and then some.\" [Daily Telegraph]\n\nThe character: Desmond Doss, a World War Two medic who became the first conscientious objector to win the prestigious US Medal of Honor.\n\nThe critics said: \"He's found a great fit for his talents in Hacksaw Ridge, which asks him to be a sweet Virginia boy courting a sweet nurse... and then a shell-shocked but determined man of valour in a lunar hellscape. Gosh, do we root for this kid.\" [Vanity Fair]\n\nThe character: Sebastian Wilder, a jazz pianist chasing his dreams in Hollywood.\n\nOscar record: Best actor nomination for Half Nelson in 2007.\n\nThe critics said: \"Mr Gosling's performance is understated, with a tinge of touching earnestness, but it's also witty and commandingly smart. What's more, he does Seb's fluent piano playing without benefit of doubles on screen or on the sound track, an achievement I found astonishing.\" [The Wall Street Journal]\n\nThe character: Ben Cash, a hippy father who has raised his children in a remote home, far from the pressures of modern life.\n\nOscar record: One previous nomination for best actor, for Eastern Promises (2008).\n\nThe critics said: \"The movie really belongs to Mortensen, who allows Ben to be exasperating, arrogant and impatient but also warm, loving and caring. He's a tough but adoring father, a grieving widower and an angry defender of his wife's final wishes, and Mortensen plays all these notes and more with subtlety and grace.\" [The Wrap]\n\nThe character: Troy Maxson, a Pittsburgh sanitation worker and former professional baseball player.\n\nOscar record: Two Oscar wins - best supporting actor for Glory (1990) and best actor for Training Day (2002). He also has a best supporting actor nomination for Cry Freedom (1988) and three best actor nominations for Malcolm X (1993), The Hurricane (2000) and Flight (2012).\n\nThe critics said: \"While Denzel Washington's direction might leave a little to be desired, his acting has never been more relentless and fierce.\" [Cinema Blend]\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Wednesday, 16:45 GMT: TV highlights on BBC Two.\n\nBritish number one Johanna Konta believes she has done everything she can to be ready for her first meeting with 22-time Grand Slam winner Serena Williams at the Australian Open.\n\nKonta, 25, will face second seed Williams in the quarter-finals at around 02:00 GMT on Wednesday.\n\n\"I've played quite a few Grand Slam champions and former world number ones,\" said world number nine Konta.\n\n\"So I've prepared myself as much as possible for a competitor like Serena.\"\n\u2022 None Confident Konta 'can improve in every aspect'\n\nKonta beat Russian 30th seed Ekaterina Makarova 6-1 6-4 to reach the last eight without dropping a set.\n\nShe has a 2-1 winning record over Serena's sister Venus - a seven-time Grand Slam winner and former world number one - including a first-round victory at last year's Australian Open.\n\nIt will be Konta's second quarter-final at a Grand Slam, after reaching the semi-final in Melbourne last year, compared to 35-year-old Serena's 47th.\n\n\"I've been fortunate enough that I've played her sister a few times and I think she's just as incredible,\" said Konta.\n\n\"I was thinking I'd love the opportunity to be on court with her before she retires. But I doubt she's talking retirement.\n\n\"She will be playing until the very last ball she can physically hit. Hopefully it won't be the last time I play her before she retires.\"\n\nSerena, in pursuit of her seventh Australian Open title, had only played two matches between the end of the US Open in August and her first-round victory in Melbourne.\n\nKonta, meanwhile, remained busy on tour and took her world ranking from 49 at the end of 2015 to a career-high of nine.\n\n\"I watch her game a lot. She's been doing really, really well, She has a very attacking game and I look forward to it,\" said Serena.\n\n\"I have absolutely nothing to lose in this tournament. Everything here is a bonus for me. Obviously I am here to win, and hopefully I can play better.\"\n\n\"The game is there for Konta. It's all about the head now.\n\nFind out how to get into tennis in our special guide.\n\n\"It's a big ask when you've never played Serena Williams to beat her at a Grand Slam quarter-final but you never know. She's got the game to beat anyone.\n\n\"She needs to follow her game plan, believe in it and commit on every shot. If you have doubts then Serena eats you alive.\"\n\n\"I think Serena's looked great. There can't be any of these second-gear starts she had a few years ago.\n\n\"The match against Konta is another level. It will help Konta that she hasn't played her - there is no scar tissue.\n\n\"Serena wins her matches often in the first 15 seconds she strolls on to the court, but that's not going to happen with Jo.\"",

            "section": "Magazine",
            "content": "Christy Kroboth gave up her career as a dental nurse to focus on animals with a lot more teeth - alligators. When she started training as an alligator catcher she was the only woman in her class, but - as she describes here - that made her even more determined to show she could jump on an animal many times her size, and tape its jaws tightly shut.\n\nWhen I first got my licence I was only doing this as a hobby, I'd go to work as a dental assistant and catch my alligators on the side.\n\nBut I got well known for taking the alligators alive, and I'm now doing this as my full time job.\n\nI've been a true animal lover all my life. I blame it on my mom. When we were little she was the one that would stop the car, pull over, and help turtles and ducks cross the road. We took in all the strays - cats, dogs, whatever needed a home.\n\nWhere I live in the south part of Texas we have a lot of alligators and there are these big master-plan communities that have manmade ponds and these ponds have alligators in them.\n\nThe homeowners are so afraid that they're going to eat their kids and that they're going to eat their dogs, but in the past 100 years we've only had one person killed by an alligator, so it's all just superstition.\n\nThese alligators have been around since the dinosaurs. They're great for the ecosystem, they keep all the aquatic life in check. They're actually really shy animals and they don't want to hurt anybody.\n\nBut people think of these guys as monsters. They have this vision in their head, and when I noticed this I thought, \"What can I do to help change people's mindset?\"\n\nAfter reports that golfers were being mean to this giant alligator, Kroboth was called in to safely remove it from a Texan golf course\n\nYou can't just go out and catch an alligator because alligators are protected by the state here in Texas. You have to have a special licence and a permit.\n\nI registered to be an alligator hunter with Texas Parks and Wildlife and we had to go through a whole training course.\n\nI was the only girl in the class and also the youngest. We had to go through the rules, laws and regulations, and then the trainer told us: \"OK, you've all passed the paperwork, now let's go do this hands-on.\"\n\nI'd never even touched an alligator before and for a split second I thought, \"I can't do this.\" I called my mom and I said, \"Mom, I can't do this!\" And, of course, mom is like, \"Come home right now, don't do it!\"\n\nBut something told me: \"I have to do this - not only for the alligators, but to prove to these big ol' country boys that I can.\"\n\nI ran out to the pond, got the alligator, taped him up and ended up passing the test. It was one of the happiest moments of my life and that adrenaline rush lasted the whole day.\n\nThe biggest alligator I've ever caught was a 13ft (4m) male weighing more than 900lb (408kg). I'm 120lb (54kg), so he outweighed me by a good amount.\n\nHe was blind and lost in a parking lot and could not find his way back to the water.\n\nUsually we catch alligators by grabbing their jaws with both hands. Once you feel comfortable enough you let go with one hand and you reach the other hand into your pocket, grab your electrical [insulating] tape and tape his mouth shut. You've got to move fast.\n\nWell, this alligator was so big that my hands would not fit around his jaws. I was trying to call my buddies to help, but it was six o'clock in the morning and none of my volunteers were answering.\n\nI was able to sucker one of the local cops into trying to help me, but he didn't want to put his hands around the alligator's mouth, which is understandable.\n\nAnother way to catch an alligator is to try to outweigh them by jumping on their back, so I talked this poor cop into jumping on to the back of this alligator with me.\n\nThe trick is you put all your weight down and sit completely down on the alligator. Well, the officer didn't and he kind of just danced around the alligator which any untrained person probably would.\n\nThe alligator didn't like that, so he started wiggling around, trying to get away. I knew instantly this was not going to work, so I stood up to back off and the alligator swatted me with his tail and made me fall on my bottom right there beside his un-taped mouth.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Christy Kroboth and police officer in action in the car park\n\nWe were all worn out from trying to catch this alligator for four hours, the parking lot was getting busy and stores were starting to open so I had to make the decision to call in a game warden.\n\nI got very sad because game wardens usually don't come out and catch alligators, game wardens usually come out and kill alligators.\n\nI went to my car and I started crying because I'd been defeated by this animal. I called the game warden and he said, \"Christy, stop crying. I am going to come help you. Do not touch that alligator until I get there.\"\n\nWell, when he said that I just got so much energy, I was so happy. I got out of my car like I could just conquer the world because somebody was coming to help me.\n\nSomehow I was able to go up to the alligator and hold his jaws in my arm and tape his mouth shut with my right hand. We ran to Home Depot and got zip ties to tie the alligator's hands behind his back like he was in handcuffs so he couldn't walk off.\n\nThen the game warden showed up and he said, \"I told you not to catch him!\"\n\nI said, \"I'm sorry, I just had all this confidence and I was able to do it!\"\n\nWe had to borrow a forklift to pick the alligator up and load him in to my buddy's truck, because he was so big.\n\nPotentially dangerous alligators that cannot be released back into the wild are taken to a farm with tons of acreage and tons of ponds. But if the alligator can be released in the wild we have certain release sites where we can drop them off.\n\nI have an SUV and sometimes the smaller alligators will want to climb over the seats and try to make their way to the front to help me drive, so it's me and the alligator waving at people going down the freeways.\n\nI've found out if you make it freezing cold in your car the alligators are calmer. So although it's the middle of summertime here in Houston - 97F (36C), humidity - I'm on the freeway in a jacket with gloves and a scarf and a blanket wrapped around me because my car is freezing cold.\n\nBut the alligator is behaving, so that's all that matters.\n\nSometimes they go to the bathroom, and alligator poo is not that great, so we'll have to roll down the windows and travel on down the road.\n\nBeing the animal lover I am I think it's very important that we educate everybody on the animals that are living in their backyards and help them understand that we can all live together.\n\nI have three educational alligators, their names are Cam, Taylor and Halo. We call them our \"edugators\" because we take them to schools and we teach people alligator safety and alligator education.\n\nI work with these alligators every single day, they're used to being handled so they don't see us as a threat. They'll even sit on the couch and watch TV with me when they're not in their enclosures.\n\nWhen I go out on a catch sometimes there's a very afraid person there whose mindset is changed. They may say, \"Oh, I understand his importance now, I like him, let's name him.\" When I see that change in people that's what really drives me to do what I do.\n\nThat's why I wake up and why I do my job every single day.\n\nListen to Christy Kroboth speaking to Outlook on the BBC World Service\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.",

            "content": "The biggest prize at the Oscars on Sunday is saved for last - the Academy Award for best picture.\n\nThis year, nine films are nominated.\n\nIf you've not had a chance (or the desire) to see them all, here's a guide to what you need to know - which means that this contains spoilers.\n\nMake sure you read this before going anywhere near a water cooler on Monday morning.\n\n\"What do you mean, I'm not nominated for best actress?\"\n\nWho's in it and who directed it? Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker and some aliens that look like giant squid are the main stars. Denis Villeneuve is the director.\n\nWhat's it about? Aliens. NO WAIT COME BACK.\n\nAmy Adams plays Louise Banks, a linguistics expert who is called in by the US Army to translate what aliens who have landed at random spots around the world are trying to say.\n\nOh, one small thing, she can also see into the future. And has to deal with the fact that she knows her future daughter is going to die of cancer. So yeah, it's pretty intense.\n\nWhat did the critics say? \"An intelligent, eloquent and stirring sci-fi that grips from start to finish, Arrival is up there with the year's best movies.\" [Total Film]\n\nHow likely is it to win? It's picked up a string of trophies during awards season already, but it would it's unlikely to take home the main prize at the Oscars.\n\nTalking point: Even though it's up for best picture, Amy Adams failed to secure a nomination in the best actress category - she was nominated at the Golden Globes and Baftas, though.\n\nWho's in it and who directed it? Viola Davis and Denzel Washington play husband and wife Troy and Rose Maxson. Washington also directed the film, based on the August Wilson play Fences.\n\nWhat's it about? This family drama set in 1950s America is centred around the domineering Troy Maxson, who rules his home with an iron fist and has a volatile relationship with his son Cory.\n\nThat's not to say he doesn't have a loving relationship with Rose, but it's fair to say her patience is tested by his behaviour later in the film (spoiler: he cheats).\n\nWhat did the critics say? \"It's all too seldom that a feature film combines brilliant acting with a spellbinding flow of language.\" [The Wall Street Journal]\n\nHow likely is it to win? While Washington and Davis are great, the film isn't exactly... cinematic. This one is an outsider.\n\nTalking point: It's not the first time Washington and Davis have played these roles - they were the Maxsons on Broadway in 2010, winning Tony Awards for their performances.\n\nWho's in it and who directed it? Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn, Hugo Weaving and Teresa Palmer are in the cast of this Mel Gibson war epic.\n\nWhat's it about? The true story of a guy called Desmond Doss, a World War Two medic who joined the army but refused to even touch a gun - due both to his Christian faith and the fact he has a violent father.\n\nHe struggles to be accepted in the army at first but goes on to single-handedly save the lives of 75 men. Warning: it's quite (okay, extremely) gory.\n\nWhat did the critics say? \"Thanks to some of the greatest battle scenes ever filmed, Gibson once again shows his staggering gifts as a film-maker, able to juxtapose savagery with aching tenderness.\" [Rolling Stone]\n\nHow likely is it to win? It's currently the seventh favourite out of the nine - so not very.\n\nTalking point: The film has been seen as something of a comeback for Mel Gibson. His nomination of best director is a sign of him being welcomed back into Hollywood after his career hit rock bottom.\n\nWho's in it and who directed it? Jeff Bridges, Ben Foster and Chris Pine star; David Mackenzie directed.\n\nWhat's it about? An ex-con (Foster) and his brother (Pine) resort to robbing banks in an attempt save their family's Texan ranch after the death of their mother. Bridges plays the ranger on their case.\n\nIt's been described as a modern Western, but it could also be described as a cops and robbers drama with slices of sharp comedy, or a study of two brothers battling against the system.\n\nWhat did the critics say?: \"Hell or High Water is a thrillingly good movie - a crackerjack drama of crime, fear and brotherly love set in a sun-roasted, deceptively sleepy West Texas that feels completely exotic for being so authentic.\" [Variety]\n\nHow likely is it to win? It's gritty, heartfelt and beautifully written, but it's fair to say this is the rank outsider. And you could be forgiven for it having gone under your radar - it was released in the UK last September, and in August in the US.\n\nTalking point: The producers had to deal with sweltering conditions and rattlesnakes during filming, describing the conditions as \"insufferable\". What's that saying about suffering for your art..?\n\nWho's in it and who directed it? Taraji P Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae play the three leads. Theodore Melfi directs.\n\nWhat's it about? Three female mathematicians take jobs at Nasa during the 1960s space race, challenging racial and sexist prejudice along the way.\n\nKatherine Johnson is made to drink from a \"coloured\" coffee urn and go on 40-minute breaks to get to the \"coloured\" toilets on the other side of the NASA campus, despite being one of the brightest brains of the whole project.\n\nWhat did the critics say? \"Hidden Figures, both a dazzling piece of entertainment and a window into history, bucks the trend of the boring-math-guy movie.\" [Time]\n\nHow likely is it to win? Could be a surprise winner - and it would definitely be a popular one. The film has done incredibly well at the box office.\n\nTalking point: Free screenings of the film have been put on in the US for young girls who are likely to be inspired by it.\n\nWho's in it and who directed it? Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are the all-singing, all-dancing stars in Damien Chazelle's film.\n\nWhat's it about? For those who've been buried under a rock (or just refuse to be swept along by the hype)... the musical traces the stories of aspiring actress Mia and pianist Sebastian, who dreams of opening his own jazz club.\n\nWhat did the critics say? \"Audacious, retro, funny and heartfelt, La La Land is the latest great musical for people who don't like musicals - and will slap a mile-wide smile across the most miserable of faces.\" [Empire]\n\nHow likely is it to win? Very. Like, very very. Bookies say it is the overwhelming favourite - and it doesn't hurt that it's a film all about Hollywood itself.\n\nTalking point: Some have deigned to suggest that La La Land is overhyped and overrated - but that hasn't stopped its juggernaut-like journey through awards season.\n\nWho's in it and who directed it? Sunny Pawar is Saroo as a young boy, with Dev Patel playing him as an adult. There's also Rooney Mara and Nicole Kidman. The film is directed by Garth Davis.\n\nWhat's it about? This is the staggering true story of a young Indian boy who is adopted after losing his family at a young age.\n\nBut he manages to find them again, decades later. With a bit of help from Google Earth.\n\nWhat did the critics say? \"The beauty of Lion is that it explores and allows for the unique possibilities and power of multiple homes, multiple families and multiple selves.\" [The Chicago Tribune]\n\nHow likely is it to win? Dev is certainly in the frame for best supporting actor, but it's not that likely to translate to best picture success.\n\nTalking point: It's been making people cry. A lot. And not just audiences - both Dev and Nicole Kidman say the script made them weep. So if you go to see it, take tissues.\n\nWho's in it and who directed it? Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams star, with Kenneth Lonergan the director.\n\nWhat's it about? Caretaker Lee Chandler, played by Affleck, has to look after his teenage nephew after his brother (the boy's father) dies.\n\nAnd he does this while still grieving for his own young children, who died in a house fire. It's safe to say this film is short on laughs.\n\nWhat did the critics say? \"Manchester by the Sea is heartbreaking yet somehow heartening, a film that just wallops you with its honesty, its authenticity and its access to despair.\" [Los Angeles Times]\n\nHow likely is it to win? The Academy tends to like gritty, serious films which could explain why it's currently fourth favourite.\n\nTalking point: The original idea was thought up by Matt Damon and John Krasinski, from the US version of The Office. Damon was actually meant to star as Lee originally, but had other filming commitments.\n\nWho's in it and who directed it? Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris and Janelle Monae star in Barry Jenkins's film.\n\nWhat's it about? Moonlight tells the story of a young man named Chiron through three stages of his life, as he battles life in extreme poverty with an abusive drug addict mother, all the while trying to come to terms with his sexuality.\n\nHe has one gay experience in his teenage years but struggles to accept his sexuality in a neighbourhood that is largely hostile towards it.\n\nWhat did the critics say? \"It's a thrilling, deeply necessary work that opens up a much-needed and rarely approached on-screen conversation about the nature of gay masculinity.\" [The Guardian]\n\nHow likely is it to win? It's currently second favourite and has been picking up awards left, right and centre - so watch this space.\n\nTalking point: Naomie Harris is nominated for best supporting actress - yet she managed to squeeze all of her filming into just three days.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

It was not right in today's world,\" he said.\n\n\"The decision-making is not as effective as it needs to be. Clearly it has to be improved.\"\n\nEcclestone has been removed as chief executive but offered a new advisory role as chairman emeritus.\n\nCarey said Liberty had major plans to grow F1 around the world. He said:\n\u2022 None F1 is a \"unique, iconic, global event that is a spectacle second to none\"\n\u2022 None The sport has not grown in recent years as much as it needed to and Liberty could exploit new technologies to do that\n\u2022 None Liberty would protect historic races and sees Europe as the \"foundation\" of the sport\n\u2022 None It would expand, particularly with a view to new events in the US\n\u2022 None Liberty wanted to make much more of the promotion of F1 itself, its participants and individual events\n\u2022 None despite speculation Silverstone could be dropped by 2019\n\nCarey was installed in September and said he had decided over the past four months that Ecclestone, 86, was no longer the right person to run F1.\n\n\"We needed a sport that while respecting what made it great has a sense of energy and innovation,\" Carey said.\n\n\"In many ways, in a simplistic sense, the sport said 'no' too much and we have to start saying 'yes' - not gimmick it up but find ways to do new and exciting things to have the sport continue to grow and interest and excite people.\"\n\nHe said Ecclestone had not been happy about the change but had accepted his new role.\n\n\"I would expect this is difficult for Bernie,\" Carey said. \"He has run this sport for his entire adult life and I respect completely that this is a difficult change.\n\n\"We have tried to deal with him with the respect he's due, which is why we offered him the chairman emeritus title.\n\n\"I have been sincere in saying I value his help and advice as we go forward.\n\n\"He calls himself a dictator. He has run it as a one-man dictator for a long time. I think the sport needs a fresh perspective. But he has a lot to continue to offer and he will always be part of the F1 family.\"\n\nLiberty has brought in former Mercedes F1 team boss Ross Brawn and ex-ESPN sales executive Sean Bratches to run the sporting and commercial sides of F1 under him.\n\u2022 None We will have a British Grand Prix - Carey\n\n'One of the benefits is a fresh start'\n\nCarey added the governance of F1 needed an overhaul.\n\n\"I don't know whether the decision-making is not what it should be because there is too much history amongst the players,\" he said.\n\n\"One of the benefits we bring is a fresh start. We don't have an agenda other than to make the sport great for its fans and that gives us an opportunity to look at how do we create more of a partnership - everybody has a shared vision of where do we want to go and we can align that vision and have everybody trying to move in the same direction.\"\n\n'We must make the story everything it can be'\n\nCarey said he felt F1 was not making the most of its appeal to fans around the world.\n\n\"Bernie deserves enormous credit for the sport he built,\" Carey said. \"It just got sold for $8bn so the proof is in the numbers.\n\n\"But the reality is to be competitive in today's world you need to continue to find ways to connect and excite fans and we need to use all the digital platforms available, have a marketing capability to tell the stories of the rivalries of the stars.\n\n\"They are larger-than-life personalities and you have to take advantage of all the rules to make that story everything it can be, have to make events larger than ever, music and entertainment with sport at the centre of it.\n\n\"I have talked about 21 Super Bowls and that is really what we should have. And then work with our partners - teams, sponsors, promoters, regulator - to ensure the race itself is everything it can be.\"\n\nWill the teams buy shares in F1?\n\nLiberty is to give F1 teams the opportunity to buy equity in the sport. They have rejected an initial offer but talks are ongoing.\n\n\"We would like to be more aligned with the teams and those discussions are ongoing,\" Carey said.\n\n\"We initially made a proposal that had too short a timeframe and we have found a way to have discussion that can have an appropriate level of exchange.\n\n\"Out of discussions of equity will be discussions of where do we want the sport to be. There is a great deal of interest in the equity but first and foremost it is about trying to create more of an alignment with the teams about the future of the business.\"\n\nHe added Liberty would look at the prize-money structure, which many inside the sport believe is too skewed in favour of the leading teams.\n\n\"We'd like owning a team to be good business, running a track to be good business and F1 is a good business, and together we are all figuring out how to share in making the whole business stronger,\" Carey said. \"But dealing with revenue is complicated.\"\n\n'We want races to be more successful'\n\nMany European races are struggling to cope with the high race fees Ecclestone demanded, but Carey said he hoped to find a way to make them more successful financially.\n\n\"I don't think we will make them more affordable,\" he said. \"We will make them more successful. We want to be more of a partner. To be in the US we are not going to own tracks but we will be more of a partner in trying to figure it out.\n\n\"We think these events should be bigger and more profitable than they are and we think, properly run, these events should continue to grow and be even more successful.\"\n\n'What drivers do is unique'\n\nCarey said the leading drivers were \"great personalities\" and he wanted to \"provide enough opportunities for fans to connect with those personalities\".\n\nAnd he added safety was \"critical\".\n\n\"Go and watch one of these cars drive down a track,\" he said. \"Anyone who tells me that is not dangerous by definition and awe-inspiring hasn't been to one of these races.\n\n\"What they do is truly unique. We have a responsibility to make it as safe as we can without undermining the sport.\"",

            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Cycling\n\nEx-Olympic champion Nicole Cooke says she is \"sceptical\" of Team Sky's drug-free credentials and Sir Bradley Wiggins' therapeutic use exemptions.\n\nWiggins was granted three TUEs to take anti-inflammatory drug triamcinolone before the 2011 and 2012 Tour de France and the 2013 Giro d'Italia.\n\n\"Taking TUEs just before major events raises questions for me,\" Cooke said.\n\nCooke also told MPs British Cycling is run \"by men for men\" and its attempts to stop doping are \"ineffective\".\n\nWiggins' TUEs were approved by British authorities and cycling's world governing body the UCI, and there is no suggestion either the 36-year-old or his former employers Team Sky have broken any rules.\n\nCooke, 33, made the claims in evidence submitted to a Culture, Media and Sport select committee on Tuesday.\n\nThe committee is examining doping in sport and Tuesday's session was held to discuss issues raised at a previous hearing involving British Cycling and Team Sky in December.\n\nIn a wide-ranging testimony, Cooke provided examples of sexism she had encountered in her 13-year career, stating British Cycling shows \"discrimination and favouritism\" because it is \"answerable to itself\".\n\nThe Welsh former world and Commonwealth cycling champion added that the fight against doping is \"the wrong people fighting the wrong war, in the wrong way, with the wrong tools\".\n\n\"While there is still a way to go, British Cycling is absolutely committed to resolving the historic gender imbalance in our sport,\" said the governing body in a statement.\n\nBritish Cycling is the subject of an investigation by UK Anti-Doping into allegations of wrongdoing in the sport and is also awaiting the findings of an independent review into an alleged bullying culture.\n\nFive-time Olympic champion Wiggins was granted a TUE to treat asthma and allergies, which was revealed when hacking group Fancy Bears released athletes' medical files stolen from the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).\n\nCooke compared her use of the steroid triamcinolone with that of Wiggins, stating she was granted a TUE for injections of the drug to treat a career-threatening knee injury as an alternative to surgery.\n\nShe said she did not race again until \"long after the performance-enhancing effects had worn off\", and she added that Wiggins appeared to use the \"same steroid before his main goals of the season\".\n\nCooke added she found the chronology of Wiggins' TUEs \"disturbing\" and that it made her \"sceptical\" of what Team Sky have done.\n\nThe team was launched in 2010 with a zero-tolerance approach towards doping in cycling.\n\nCooke on the package delivered to Wiggins\n\nAn inquiry by Ukad was launched following a Daily Mail allegation that a medical package was delivered to Wiggins on the final day of the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine.\n\nTeam Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford told MPs in December that the package contained legal decongestant Fluimucil, but MP Damian Collins, chair of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, says British Cycling have been unable to provide paperwork to prove the contents of the medical package.\n\n\"I find the stance of being the cleanest team, yet Dave Brailsford not being able to say what a rider took, definitely makes it hard to back up that claim,\" Cooke added.\n\nShe also raised concerns as to why Simon Cope, who was British Cycling women's coach at the time, was chosen to courier the package to Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman in France.\n\n\"I do find it very surprising that Simon Cope transported something internationally without knowing what was in it,\" Cooke told MPs.\n\nShe also alleged that Cope, a former team-mate of Wiggins at the Linda McCartney professional team, \"spent some weeks riding a moped in front of Wiggins as part of a training regimen\" as an example of how resources were \"stripped out of the women's program to augment the men's program\".\n\n'They did nothing for women'\n\nWhen asked by MPs if sexism was culturally embedded in British Cycling, Cooke said: \"Yes I do\".\n\nShe claimed that during her career, the governing body showed only \"transient\" support for female road riders.\n\nAs part of her written evidence and appearance via video-link from Paris, Cooke cited numerous examples of \"discrimination and favouritism\" shown by British Cycling.\n\nShe said the prize for the women's 2006 British Championships was a \"tiny fraction\" of the men's race, despite Cooke having just won the Grande Boucle Feminine Internationale - the women's equivalent of the Tour de France.\n\nThe 2008 road race world champion added she had to take her own skin suit to the event in Italy after British Cycling had forgotten to organise one, having to then sew a Team Sky logo onto it at the behest of Brailsford.\n\n\"The facts are they did nothing for the women,\" said Cooke.\n\nAn independent review into the culture of British Cycling began after its former technical director Shane Sutton was accused of using offensive and discriminatory language towards cyclist Jess Varnish.\n\nDespite being cleared of eight of the nine charges against him, the Australian was found guilty of using sexist language in October but denies any wrongdoing and said he would appeal the ruling.\n\nWhat has the response been?\n\nIn her written evidence, Cooke said she had \"no faith in the actions in support of investigations conducted by Ukad or the testing they conduct, both completed at significant expense to the public purse\".\n\nIn response, Ukad said: \"There should be no doubt about the determination of this organisation to protect clean sport; our staff passionately believe in protecting everyone's right to clean, fair and honest competition.\n\nRegarding Cooke's accusations of sexism, British Cycling said in a statement: \"There is always more that can be done and we strive to make continual improvements to ensure that cycling is reaching out to women and girls of all ages and abilities.\"\n\nMeanwhile, UK Sport has launched an independent review to investigate some of the issues raised by Cooke.\n\n\"UK Sport takes its responsibilities as an investor of public funds and a champion of equality in sport very seriously,\" said a spokesman.\n\n\"On matters raised relating to the governance of the national governing body, UK Sport and Sport England have recently published a new code for sports governance which raises the bar for the requirements around governance that all sports bodies who receive public funding will need to address and comply to.\"",

            "content": "Dev Patel is nominated for Lion and Viola Davis is nominated for Fences\n\nAfter the #OscarsSoWhite controversies of the last two years, 2017 promises to be a more diverse affair.\n\nIn the acting categories there are a total of seven nominees from ethnic minority backgrounds.\n\nDenzel Washington is nominated as best actor for Fences and Ruth Negga as best actress for Loving.\n\nMoonlight's Mahershala Ali and Lion's Dev Patel are up for best supporting actor.\n\nThe supporting actress category includes Viola Davis for Fences, Naomie Harris for Moonlight and Octavia Spencer for Hidden Figures.\n\nThree of the nine films up for best picture - Fences, Hidden Figures and Moonlight - feature predominantly black casts.\n\nIn the directing category, Moonlight's Barry Jenkins is only the fourth black best director nominee in Oscar history.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. This year, non-white actors have received seven Oscar nominations\n\nThe first was John Singleton, nominated in 1992 for Boyz n the Hood. He was followed by Lee Daniels, for Precious in 2010, and 12 Years a Slave's Steve McQueen in 2014. McQueen's film won best picture but he lost the best director prize to Gravity's Alfonso Cuaron.\n\nIn the documentary feature category, Ava DuVernay's 13th is up against I Am Not Your Negro from Raoul Peck and Ezra Edelman's OJ: Made In America. (With a running time of seven hours and 47 minutes, OJ is the longest film ever nominated for an Academy Award.)\n\nThe two-year diversity drought in the acting categories inspired the #OscarsSoWhite backlash on social media.\n\nOf course, most of this year's nominated films were already in production well before that furore erupted.\n\nMoonlight's Jenkins has told the BBC his film was not a response to the #OscarsSoWhite criticism, having conceived the project \"at least three-and-a-half years ago\".\n\nBut the outcry did lead the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which awards the Oscars, to take steps to make its membership more diverse.\n\nHas that made a difference this year? Hollywood Reporter's Oscars guru Scott Feinberg thinks not.\n\n\"The Academy may claim that this is the result of it flooding its organization with an unprecedented number of diverse new members this year, but I maintain that these nominees, up against the same competition, would have been nominated in either of the last two years,\" he writes in his Oscars analysis.\n\nIn June 2016, the Academy invited almost 700 new members to join, with a focus on women and ethnic minorities.\n\nOne of those new members is British film director Amma Asante, whose film about an interracial marriage A United Kingdom opened the London Film Festival.\n\nShe told me last year that the organisers of the Oscars needed to keep up the momentum on its actions to improve diversity.\n\n\"I don't know the change happens overnight,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm interested to see what will happen in two Oscars' time.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Wednesday, 16:45 GMT: TV highlights on BBC Two.\n\nSeventeen-time Grand Slam winner Roger Federer says he did not expect to reach the Australian Open semi-finals after a six-month injury lay-off.\n\nThe four-time champion in Melbourne is making his competitive return after last playing at Wimbledon in July.\n\nFederer beat Mischa Zverev 6-1 7-5 6-2 to set up Thursday's last-four match against fellow Swiss Stan Wawrinka.\n\n\"Feeling as good as I am, playing as good as I am, that's a huge surprise to me,\" said the 35-year-old.\n\u2022 None Confident Konta 'can improve in every aspect'\n\n\"If someone would have told me I'd play in the semis against Stan, never would I have called that one.\n\n\"For Stan, yes, but not for me. I honestly didn't even know a few days ago that he was in my section of the draw or I'm in his section.\"\n\nFederer, who has not won a Grand Slam title since triumphing at Wimbledon in 2012, had been sidelined by a knee injury throughout the second half of last year and has slipped from third in the world to 17th.\n\nHe played in the non-ranking Hopman Cup in Perth earlier in January, but has come through 18 sets in Melbourne.\n\n\"I think winning back-to-back matches in best-of-five sets against quality, great players has surprised me most,\" he said.\n\n\"Really that's been for me the big question mark, if I could do that so early in my comeback.\n\n\"I felt I was always going to be dangerous on any given day in a match situation. But obviously as the tournament would progress, maybe I would fade away with energy, you know, that kind of stuff.\"\n\n'Roger's the best of all time'\n\nFederer holds an 18-3 winning record against Wawrinka, but the 31-year-old will go into the semi-final as the world number four and looking for a second consecutive Grand Slam title after last year's US Open success.\n\nFederer has won their past two meetings, at the ATP World Tour Finals and in the US Open in 2015, but Wawrinka holds a Grand Slam win against his Davis Cup team-mate, coming in the quarter-finals of the French Open in the same year.\n\n\"Against Roger, it's always special because he's so good. He's the best player of all time,\" said the three-time Grand Slam winner.\n\n\"He has an answer for everything. But I managed to beat him in a Grand Slam, so we'll see.\n\n\"It's great to see him back at that level. Hopefully I can manage to play a great match.\"\n\nStan, you don't call any more\n\nAll of Wawrinka's three Grand Slam titles have come since Federer won his last five years ago.\n\nAnd Wawrinka's rise to becoming a consistent top-10 player did not come until he was aged 28, and after plenty of help from his fellow Swiss.\n\n\"I remember giving Stan a lot of advice on how he should play certain guys,\" said Federer.\n\n\"Then the day came where he didn't call me so much any more. He called me less and less.\n\n\"I also felt like I didn't tell him any more, because he created his knowledge, his base, had his team. Only from time to time would I give him advice if he asked me.\n\n\"Otherwise I was happy that he was able to let go and go on his own path.\"\n\nIt's a great match because Wawrinka wants to stay back and bludgeon the ball with huge swings and power.\n\nFederer's job, in the lively conditions, is to take time away from Wawrinka and not allow him to get into that rhythm. Federer has to come forward and test Wawrinka's passing shots a lot.\n\nThat's important because I don't think Stan's the best passer in the world. Roger will be able to come in a lot because Wawrinka does chip and block a lot of first-serve returns.\n\nThe way Federer is playing, even though he has missed six months of tennis, I think he's maybe the slight favourite from what I've seen.",
