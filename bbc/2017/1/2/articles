            "content": "Benedict Cumberbatch is back as Sherlock for the new three-part series\n\nMore than eight million people tuned in to see the return of Sherlock on BBC One on Sunday, overnight ratings show.\n\nThat means it was the UK's second-most watched programme of the festive period - behind the New Year's Eve fireworks, which were watched by 11.6 million.\n\nThe biggest Christmas Day audience came for the Queen's Christmas message, which was seen by 7.7 million people.\n\nThe first episode of the fourth series of Sherlock had an average audience of 8.1 million.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Benedict Cumberbatch talks about the new Sherlock series\n\nThe episode, entitled The Six Thatchers, was based on Arthur Conan Doyle's story The Adventure of the Six Napoleons and involved six smashed statues of the former UK prime minister.\n\nIt \"reached new heights of action and emotion\", according to The Guardian's Mark Lawson, who saw parallels between Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes and James Bond.\n\nHe wrote: \"The episode felt very Bond overall - Holmes has never done so much running towards or away from explosions.\"\n\nThe Telegraph's Ben Lawrence wrote that it was \"a dizzying triumph of complex plotting (although the much-talked-about demolition of six busts of Margaret Thatcher was an unnecessary piece of iconoclasticism) and beautifully choreographed action scenes\".\n\nMartin Freeman has made Watson \"a nuanced, compelling character\", he said, but added: \"It is, of course, Cumberbatch's show and here he looked tanned and lean, ready for action but heading, ultimately, for a fall.\n\n\"Cumberbatch is an actor who invests so much in every scene that watching him is an exhilarating experience and an almost psychological exercise.\"\n\nThe programme's overnight ratings were slightly down compared with those for last year's New Year's Day one-off Sherlock special, which had 8.4 million.\n\nElsewhere in Sunday's BBC One schedule, Mrs Brown's Boys was watched by an estimated 6.7 million, while six million saw Ronnie and Roxy Mitchell's demise in EastEnders.\n\nEastEnders narrowly lost the battle of the soaps to Coronation Street, which attracted 6.2 million on ITV.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

            "content": "In India, 2016 has been a year of political surprises, alcohol ban and heated debates about nationalism, and plenty of other news in between.\n\nThe BBC's in-house cartoonist Kirtish Bhat picks five news events to give his humorous take on 2016.\n\nTwo news events in February were all about freedom. One firm launched the world's cheapest smartphone, priced at 251 rupees ($3.67; \u00a33), and called it Freedom 251. At the same time, police arrested some students in Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University for allegedly raising anti-India slogans, and demanding \"freedom\" for Kashmir from Indian rule. The students denied the allegations, but they were charged with sedition. Later, they were freed on bail.\n\nIndia's flamboyant businessman Vijay Mallya made his fortune selling beer under the Kingfisher brand and branched out into aviation, Formula1 racing, and Indian cricket. But he incurred huge debts because of the failure of his airline. Many have criticised banks for their inability in recovering the debt from Mr Mallya, who denies any wrongdoing. He is currently living in the UK, and hasn't returned to India despite repeated summons by the authorities.\n\nWhen the chief minister of the eastern state of Bihar, Nitish Kumar, promised during his election campaign that he would ban the sale and consumption of alcohol if elected, not many thought he would actually do it. But then he proved everybody wrong!\n\nWhen Prime Minister Narendra Modi took office in 2014, he promised to change the country. But his critics say that he has been concentrating more on foreign policy, and travelling the world.\n\nIn one of the biggest surprises of 2016, Mr Modi on 8 November announced the scrapping of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes to crack down on corruption and illegal cash holdings known as \"black money\". The sudden announcement made many people's cash worthless.",

            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nTen-man Manchester City moved up to third as they withstood a spirited Burnley fightback in front of a relieved Etihad Stadium.\n\nFernandinho was dismissed towards the end of an even first half for a two-footed challenge on Johan Gudmundsson.\n\nBut the hosts improved after the break as Gael Clichy squeezed home a shot before Sergio Aguero, on as a substitute, fired home from a tight angle.\n\nBen Mee smashed home via the underside of the bar shortly after but Burnley could not force a leveller despite a fine chance for Andre Gray late on.\n\nBeginning the day 10 points behind leaders Chelsea, anything less than victory would have prompted some to begin reading the last rites on City's title challenge.\n\nAs it is, Pep Guardiola's side will look at the league table with renewed optimism as they closed to within two points of second-place Liverpool with one and possibly both of Chelsea and Tottenham to drop points when they face each other on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, Fernandinho's dismissal meant they had to fight harder than they might have expected for victory.\n\nThe City captain took some of the ball as he contested a 50:50 ball in midfield, but his reckless scissor-action style meant that referee Lee Mason's decision to show red could be easily justified.\n\nIt is not the first time City's discipline has hindered their title ambitions. Including Sergio Aguero's retrospective red against West Ham, they have been shown seven red cards in Guardiola's 30 games in charge.\n\nFernandinho's third red card in six games for City means he will be banned for four matches and not available again until 5 February.\n\nShould Fernandinho have been sent off? MOTD analysis\n\nFormer Republic of Ireland midfielder Kevin Kilbane: \"There's no doubt it is a red for Fernandinho. It is quite clear. He's reckless and out of control. Referee Lee Mason is in a good position. It is a bad one. You see those sort of challenges and you hope for the best for the opposing player.\"\n\nEx-Arsenal defender Martin Keown: \"It is a 100% red card all day long. His third in six games. It is indefensible, you don't want to see that in the game.\"\n\nAguero off the bench and to the rescue\n\nWell before Fenandinho's lunging challenge, Guardiola's team selection seemed to have hampered rather than helped City's cause.\n\nAguero, who was spared the rigours of the festive fixture list after only making his comeback from a four-match ban in the New Year's Eve defeat by Liverpool, was left on the bench with Kelechi Iheanacho preferred up front.\n\nIheanacho missed the best of what little City created in the first half and Aguero brought a more threatening edge to the hosts' attack when he was introduced alongside David Silva at half-time.\n\nThe Argentine's dead-eyed finish from a tight angle, past two covering defenders, provided the winner and convincing evidence for an immediate recall.\n\nBurnley come close on return to Manchester\n\nBurnley have only won a single point away from Turf Moor this season, but they can count themselves unlucky not to follow their October draw at Old Trafford with similar on their return to Manchester.\n\nWhile they confounded United with a stubborn rearguard action, Sean Dyche's side went toe-to-toe with City even before Fernandinho's red card gave them an extra man.\n\nMee's goal, awarded with help by the decision review system, exposed goalkeeper Claudio Bravo's uncertainty in the air, but Burnley created enough to take a point without City's errors.\n\nThe precision that Gray showed in scoring his hat-trick against Middlesbrough last time out deserted him in injury-time while Sam Vokes glanced just wide when well placed.\n\nThe Clarets remain 11th, eight points above the drop and well above par for the season so far.\n\u2022 None Fernandinho is the first City player to see two reds in a Premier League season since Mario Balotelli in 2011-12.\n\u2022 None Raheem Sterling has been directly involved in nine Premier League goals for City this season (5 goals, 4 assists), compared to eight in his first season at the club.\n\u2022 None Gael Clichy scored just his third Premier League goal in 311 games (two for City, one for Arsenal). His last goal came in November 2014 v Southampton.\n\u2022 None City have only kept a clean sheet in two of their 10 Premier League games at the Etihad this season.\n\u2022 None Burnley's goal was only the third they have managed away from home this season.\n\u2022 None The Clarets have still taken just one point from their away games this season, with 22 of their total of 23 coming at Turf Moor (drawing one and losing eight away).\n\n\"I'm so happy, believe me\" - manager quotes\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola gave a series of short answers to BBC Sport's Damian Johnson after the match, a selection of which appears below:\n\nDamian Johnson: \"What was your view of the red card for Fernandinho?\"\n\nPep Guardiola: \"You are the journalist. Not me.\"\n\nDJ: \"You're the manager. I'm sure the fans would like to know.\n\nPG: \"Ask the referee - not me.\"\n\nDJ: \"You don't seem that happy that you've won.\"\n\nPG: \"More than you would believe. More than you would believe I am happy.\"\n\nPG: \"I'm so happy believe me. I'm so happy. Happy new year.\"\n\nDJ: \"Are Manchester City in the title race?\"\n\nPG: \"Yesterday no. Why today are we in the title race?\"\n\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche: \"We gave away two poor goals, but the two players that they brought on at half-time are not bad players. I thought that they had an effect.\n\n\"It is a missed opportunity. We lost our way a bit when they went down to 10 men. They came out really hard and fast after half-time. We made a game of it after that. There was no lack of effort, but we could not find a way through.\n\nOn Fernandinho's red card: \"It was a red by modern standards. In years gone by, maybe not, but today I think it is.\"\n\nManchester City travel to West Ham in the third round of the FA Cup on Friday with Burnley taking on Sunderland the next day in the same competition.\n\u2022 None David Silva (Manchester City) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.\n\u2022 None Andre Gray (Burnley) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.\n\u2022 None Attempt saved. Michael Keane (Burnley) left footed shot from the centre of the box is saved in the top centre of the goal. Assisted by Stephen Ward with a cross.\n\u2022 None Attempt missed. Andre Gray (Burnley) right footed shot from the centre of the box misses to the right.\n\u2022 None Attempt missed. Sergio Ag\u00fcero (Manchester City) right footed shot from outside the box is too high. Assisted by Raheem Sterling.\n\u2022 None Delay over. They are ready to continue.

            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nJermain Defoe scored two penalties as Sunderland twice came from behind to earn a point against second-placed Liverpool.\n\nThe Reds took a deserved lead when Daniel Sturridge flicked in a header after Dejan Lovren's mishit shot.\n\nSunderland equalised six minutes later as Defoe scored from the spot following Ragnar Klavan's trip on Didier Ndong, before Sadio Mane put the visitors back ahead with a close-range finish.\n\nHowever, Mane then handled in his own 18-yard box and Defoe converted the penalty to snatch an unlikely point.\n\u2022 None Relive Sunderland's draw against Liverpool as it happened\n\u2022 None Reaction and updates from the other Premier League matches\n\nThe result leaves Liverpool five points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea, who play their game in hand on Wednesday at Tottenham (20:00 GMT kick-off).\n\nHowever, Reds boss Jurgen Klopp will surely see it as two points dropped after his side led twice, had 71% of the possession and had 15 shots on target.\n\nOnly an inspired performance from Black Cats keeper Vito Mannone denied Liverpool further goals, before Mane, playing his last game before representing Senegal at the Africa Cup of Nations, needlessly stuck out an arm to block Seb Larsson's free-kick, costing his side dearly.\n\nTo make things worse for Liverpool, Sturridge, who scored only his second Premier League goal of the season, limped off late on with an ankle injury after he clashed with Papy Djilobodji.\n\nThe England international was only making his fifth league start of the campaign, has also suffered calf and hip injuries this season and was limping badly at the final whistle.\n\nReds club captain Jordan Henderson missed the game at the Stadium of Light with a heel injury and Klopp could be without three influential players for the trip to Manchester United in 13 days' time.\n\nIn his post-match news conference Klopp said he did not believe Sturridge's injury was a serious one. \"He got a knock on his right ankle, I don't think it's too bad,\" said the German.\n\nSunderland boss David Moyes described his side's performance in their 4-1 loss at Burnley on Saturday as \"dire\" and had demanded better.\n\nHe will surely have been delighted with the response. His team battled hard, gave everything, defended deep in numbers and showed their fighting spirit when Liverpool looked like they might run away with the match.\n\nSunderland remain in the bottom three, but Moyes will be encouraged by the point as the Black Cats look to extend their 10-year Premier League stay.\n\nHowever, like Klopp, Moyes faces a battle to juggle his squad. Sunderland's lengthy injury list includes first-choice goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, defender Lamine Kone, midfielders Lee Cattermole and Steven Pienaar and strikers Duncan Watmore and Victor Anichebe.\n\nMidfielders Didier Ndong (Gabon) and Wahbi Khazri (Tunisia) are also set to play at the Africa Cup of Nations in January to provide further problems for Moyes.\n\u2022 None Liverpool have now lost just one of their past 18 Premier League games (won 12).\n\u2022 None Moyes has only one victory from his past 17 Premier League games as a manager against Liverpool (10 defeats).\n\u2022 None Jack Rodwell made his 34th start for Sunderland but is yet to be on the winning side (16 draws and 18 losses); extending the Premier League record.\n\u2022 None Defoe is the fourth player to score 10 or more goals in 10 different Premier League seasons, along with Alan Shearer, Wayne Rooney and Frank Lampard.\n\u2022 None Sunderland are the first team to score two penalties in a Premier League game against Liverpool since West Brom in April 2011.\n\u2022 None Sturridge has scored in consecutive Premier League games after a run of 12 appearances without a goal.\n\u2022 None Mane has had a hand in five goals in his past seven Premier League appearances (three goals, two assists).\n\nWhat they said\n\nSunderland manager Moyes said: \"I expect them to get results, but I'm really pleased after the few days we've had. We didn't play well (against Burnley) and what they have done is show how well they can do.\n\n\"I thought we did quite well, matched Liverpool's energy for long periods of the game and deserved a draw. We had big chances as well.\n\n\"I never thought we were out of it. The important thing was to not concede a third goal. In the end we got a deserved penalty.\n\n\"Towards the end of the season we are going to have to pick up a lot of results. Today was a tough draw and we have to make sure we win at home - that's key.\"\n\nLiverpool boss Klopp said: \"I am not able to explain it because I don't know exactly what I saw. My team were fighting but I wasn't sure if they could do it.\n\n\"We can play better but I'm not sure if you can play better with that (two-day) break.\"\n\nOn Sunderland's second penalty, the German added: \"There was no foul before the free-kick for the second penalty. You need a little bit of luck, but Sunderland worked hard too and maybe they deserved it.\"\n\nBoth sides are next in action in the third round of the FA Cup. Sunderland entertain fellow Premier League side Burnley on Saturday (15:00), one week after losing 4-1 to the Clarets in an away league match.\n\nLiverpool take on League Two high-flyers Plymouth Argyle on 8 January (13:30), before playing at Southampton on 11 January in the first leg of their EFL Cup semi-final (19:45).\n\nSunderland next play in the Premier League on 14 January with a home game against Stoke (15:00), with Liverpool away at Manchester United at 16:00 the following day.\n\u2022 None Offside, Liverpool. Lucas Leiva tries a through ball, but Divock Origi is caught offside.\n\u2022 None Attempt saved. Roberto Firmino (Liverpool) header from the centre of the box is saved in the centre of the goal. Assisted by Alberto Moreno with a cross.\n\u2022 None Attempt saved.

            "content": "The death of George Michael continues to dominate several newspaper front pages.\n\nThe Daily Mirror leads with an exclusive interview with Michael's partner, Fadi Fawaz, who reveals he slept in a car on the night the star died.\n\nIt also says Mr Fawaz denied he was responsible for several posts that appeared on his Twitter account claiming the singer \"wanted to die\" and had \"finally managed it\" after \"trying to kill himself several times\".\n\nMr Fawaz said his Twitter account had been hacked and that the account has since been shut down.\n\nThe new year attack on the Reina nightclub in Istanbul was, for the Daily Mail, the \"massacre of the beautiful people\".\n\nThe Guardian says the venue has earned a reputation as the place to be seen among Turkey's young, secular elite - attracting footballers from the top Turkish sides, TV stars, tourists, business people and celebrities from around the world.\n\nThe i's story says that for those who had wished for a new year that would see a diminution of the bloody attacks that have convulsed Turkey in recent months, their hopes survived unblemished for less than ninety minutes.\n\nAn hour after the gilded youth of Istanbul and well-heeled Middle East revellers had cheered the advent of the new year, the Times reports, the gunman began shooting and the noise turned from music to gunshots and screams.\n\nIt was by no means Turkey's worst terrorist incident, the Daily Telegraph says, but the timing and death toll among foreign nationals who were in the city to celebrate the arrival of 2017 seems intended to rip the heart out of Istanbul's tourism, and it must not be allowed to do so, the paper adds.\n\nThe prime minister is to overhaul the honours system after making clear that controversial appointments in the new year list had been put forward under David Cameron's tenure, the Times reports.\n\nAccording to the paper, Theresa May wants the honours system to have five priorities.\n\nIt will recognise those who boost the economy; support young people in achieving their potential; aid social mobility; help local communities; and tackle discrimination.\n\nThe government's plans for new garden villages in England make the lead for the Daily Telegraph.\n\nIt says Theresa May's first announcement of 2017 suggests her government will make housing one of its main priorities in the year ahead.\n\nThe ambitious scheme has won support from campaign groups - it adds - despite earlier concerns that the developments would lead to urban sprawl and put added pressure on infrastructure.\n\nThe Queen's absence from church for the second weekend in a row because of a lingering heavy cold is the Daily Mail's main story.\n\nThe paper has been told that she's on the mend, but has developed a hacking cough.\n\nA source is quoted as saying: \"Her Majesty doesn't like going to church with a cough because she thinks it's off-putting for other celebrants.\"\n\n\"Get better soon, Ma'am\", is the paper's headline.\n\nThe Guardian led with a warning from Britain's top GP that surgeries will have to stop seeing patients at some points during the week unless the government abandons its drive to guarantee access to family doctors across the weekend.\n\nDr Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, tells the paper that ministers are ignoring the lack of demand among patients to see GPs at weekends and the serious shortage of family doctors.\n\nA number of papers also criticise the annual increase in rail fares that comes into effect today.\n\nThe Daily Mail reports that even if the train companies provided a decent service, the \u00a3600 average increase in the cost of annual season tickets since 2010 would be monstrous.\n\nAt this time of disruption by the unions, it adds, the rises are simply inexcusable.\n\nIn the Telegraph's view, while it's reasonable for people to be asked to fork out more for a better service, it's galling to have to stump up more for trains that don't arrive or are jam-packed if they do.\n\nThe Daily Mail also runs with a story saying cabinet ministers have urged Theresa May to threaten the House of Lords with a \"bloodbath\" if peers seek to frustrate Brexit.\n\nAccording to the paper, senior Tories say the Prime Minister should stand ready to threaten the upper chamber with abolition or a huge cut in numbers and powers.\n\nAn un-named minister tells the paper: \"We will be sending a one-line bill to the Lords on triggering Article 50. If they send it back to the Commons, it should be returned with a second line added - the abolition of the Lords\".\n\nA Daily Telegraph investigation reveals that British expatriates are flying to the UK from their Spanish homes to earn lucrative sums as carers for the elderly, amid a spiralling crisis in social care.\n\nThe paper says thousands of expats are funding lifestyles in the sun by jetting in for fortnightly placements to take sole charge of the vulnerable, with just a few days' training.\n\nAccording to the report, many of the recruits have no professional qualifications or previous experience and are driven by financial desperation after a downturn in the Spanish economy, or to supplement income from businesses such as bars and restaurants.\n\nA familiar sight in some newspapers at this time of year is pictures of new year revellers worse for wear after a night of partying and drinking in city centres across the country.\n\nThe Daily Express says many partygoers drank so much they were unable to stand or speak.\n\n\"While some young women struggled to stay upright in towering high heels, others gave up completely and simply lay down, befuddled.\"\n\n\"Many cared little for their modesty\", the paper goes on, and they braved \"the cold and pouring rain in outfits more suited to high summer than mid-winter.\"\n\nWriting in the Daily Mail, Sarah Vine expresses her concern in an article headlined \"Pictures that make me weep for today's young women\".\n\nThe Sun has pictures of what it calls the \"bedlam\" in Hull - and quotes one reveller as saying it wasn't a good advert for the UK City of Culture.",

            "content": "Leicester Tigers have sacked director of rugby Richard Cockerill after nearly eight years in charge.\n\nThe 46-year-old has been on the Premiership club's coaching staff since 2004, took over as head coach in 2009 and became director of rugby in 2010.\n\n\"It is with great sadness and regret that I leave my position. I still believe that I am the right person to lead the team,\" Cockerill said.\n\nHead coach Aaron Mauger will take over on an interim basis.\n\nLeicester won three Premiership titles under Cockerill and were twice runners-up Leicester were runners-up in the European Cup in Cockerill's first season in charge and won the LV Cup in 2011-12\n\nTigers are fifth in the Premiership, 15 points adrift of leaders Wasps having lost five of their 12 league games so far this season. They were beaten 16-12 by Saracens on New Year's Day.\n\nCockerill, who has spent 23 of the last 25 years of his career with Tigers, said he \"respected the board's decision\" to make a change they see as being \"in the best interests of the club\".\n\nHe added: \"This club has made me the person and the coach I am today and I will never forget what they have done for me. I will miss being part of the Tigers family.\"\n\nLast month, following the 18-16 Champions Cup win over Munster, Cockerill said reports claiming he faced the sack and that described the coaching structure at Leicester Tigers as toxic were \"rubbish\".\n\u2022 None Listen: 'Lancaster would be a very good choice for Leicester'\n\nFormer England and Tigers hooker Cockerill spent 10 years with the club as a player from 1992 before returning to Welford Road as an academy coach.\n\nAfter two spells in interim charge he was appointed full-time head coach in April 2009, with Tigers winning the Premiership title and reaching the European Cup final in his first season in the role.\n\nLeicester have never failed to reach the Premiership semi-finals under Cockerill and as well as winning the final in 2008-09, they were also victorious in 2009-10 and 2012-13.\n\nTigers chairman Peter Tom CBE said: \"We thank Richard for his loyal and dedicated service as a player, coach and director of rugby. He has a great passion for the club and for the game of rugby, and has shared in many massive occasions with the Tigers.\n\n\"The club always has aspirations to contest the major honours in the game and that remains unchanged but the board believes this is the right time to make a change.\"\n\nAs a player, hooker Cockerill made 262 appearances for Tigers, winning five league titles, two domestic cups, two Heineken Cups and he also played 27 times for England.\n\nI am not surprised. Tigers cannot stand the fact they are in fifth position and quite a bit away from the top four; they want to be top two and won't get there this season.\n\nThey haven't been there for the last three or four seasons and that is one of the reasons that Tigers have reluctantly had to say goodbye to Richard.\n\nHis record is second to none. He is man and boy with the Tigers and if you cut him in half he would be Tigers colours through and through.",

            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nManchester United moved level on points with fifth-placed Tottenham after victory at West Ham, who played for 75 minutes with 10 men following the controversial dismissal of Sofiane Feghouli.\n\nReferee Mike Dean showed Feghouli a straight red card after the midfielder's 15th-minute challenge on Phil Jones.\n\nReplays showed it was more of a coming together between two players committed to winning the ball than a reckless tackle meant to cause harm.\n\nAntonio Valencia was guilty of an astonishing miss for the visitors before Juan Mata scored from 10 yards after a clever pass by fellow substitute Marcus Rashford.\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic was one of three players offside when he doubled the lead after Pedro Obiang's clearance fell to Ander Herrera.\n\nIt was Jose Mourinho's side's sixth straight Premier League win and their seventh in all competitions.\n\u2022 None Relive the action from London Stadium as it happened\n\u2022 None Listen: 'Man Utd are back in the title race'\n\nDean at the centre of controversy - again\n\nThe Hammers have beaten Bournemouth, Sunderland, Burnley and Hull at home this season, yet their hopes of claiming a first major scalp at London Stadium were undone by the fastest sending off in the Premier League this season.\n\nThere is no doubt Feghouli lost control of the ball and deserved a booking for his challenge on Jones.\n\nBut Dean, who sent off Southampton's Nathan Redmond in the 4-1 defeat by Tottenham on Wednesday, brandished a red card for the fifth time this season, much to the fury of West Ham boss Slaven Bilic.\n\nJones, who was clearly hurt and rolled over several times before receiving treatment, was booed by home fans for the rest of the game each time he touched the ball.\n\nFeghouli is now set to miss his side's FA Cup third-round home tie against Manchester City on Friday, while Hammers supporters showed their anger at the official by chanting 'Mike Dean - it's all about you'.\n\nIn the second half, Dean kept his cards in his pocket after Cheikhou Kouyate's reckless challenge on Henrikh Mkhitaryan.\n\nThis was far from vintage Manchester United, yet Mourinho's team started 2017 as they finished 2016 - with three points.\n\nThey are now unbeaten in their past 13 games in all competitions, while they have taken 25 points from the last 33 on offer.\n\nValencia will surely be haunted by his 36th-minute miss. It was a brilliant save by Darren Randolph to deny him from close range, but the Ecuador international should have buried the chance, as should Jesse Lingard, who hit the post with the follow-up.\n\nMourinho's decisions to bring on Mata at the start of the second half and Rashford before the hour mark proved decisive.\n\nThe pair combined to break West Ham's spirited resistance - the busy and menacing Rashford evading a couple of challenges before cutting back for Spaniard Mata to find the net.\n\nThe 19-year-old England striker hit the post before Ibrahimovic, standing in an offside position, scored a controversial second to complete West Ham's misery.\n\nBeaten by Leicester City on Saturday, it has been a 48 hours to forget for West Ham in terms of results.\n\nHowever, they dug deep, displayed a steely resolve - and might even have got something from the game despite the visitors' extra-man advantage.\n\nDavid de Gea twice saved well from Manuel Lanzini, before Michail Antonio's glancing header flashed agonisingly wide as the Hammers threatened.\n\nAnd shortly before Mata broke the deadlock, Antonio found himself clean through after Lanzini's perfectly weighted pass, only for De Gea to block his effort.\n\n'We are champions of bad decisions'\n\nWest Ham boss Bilic: \"I was pleased with the performance, we fought hard and gave everything. I told my players that if we did this we will be all right in the table.\n\n\"Ten men against a team like this is very hard - but we had chances.\n\n\"I am disappointed with the result and frustrated by how we lost it, but I am proud of my players.\"\n\nManchester United manager Mourinho: \"It was hard for us to think well with one more man - and it was very hard for them physically.\n\n\"I was happy with my choices in Juan Mata and Marcus Rashford, they gave us what we needed. Rashford is very professional and very mature. He is a Manchester United player with Manchester United DNA.\n\n\"I don't feel sorry for West Ham - I didn't watch the decisions. I think if you talk about decisions, we are the champions of bad decisions.\"\n\u2022 None Manchester United are now 13 games unbeaten in all competitions - longest run since March 2013 (18 games).\n\u2022 None Ibrahimovic has already scored more goals in all competitions than Manchester United's top scorer last season (Martial, 17).\n\u2022 None This is Mourinho's longest winning run in all competitions (seven) since January 2014 when in charge of Chelsea.\n\u2022 None West Ham have lost consecutive Premier League games without scoring for the first time under Bilic.\n\u2022 None Since the start of last season, no team has been shown more Premier League red cards than the Hammers (eight - level with Southampton).\n\u2022 None Mata has been involved in 40 Premier League goals (25 goals, 15 assists) since his Manchester United debut. Only Wayne Rooney with 46 - 29 goals and 17 assists - has a better record in that time.\n\u2022 None Dean has shown 14 red cards in the Premier League since the start of last season - at least six more than any other referee.\n\nWest Ham are back in action on Friday when they host fellow Premier League side Manchester City in the FA Cup third round (19:55 GMT kick-off).\n\nManchester United start their defence of the famous trophy at home against Championship club Reading - managed by former Old Trafford defender Jaap Stam - on Saturday (12:30).\n\u2022 None H\u00e5vard Nordtveit (West Ham United) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.\n\u2022 None Attempt blocked.

            "section": "Magazine",
            "content": "American wildlife photographer Joel Sartore is fighting to save endangered species by making us fall in love with them.\n\nJoel Sartore had been a National Geographic wildlife photographer for 15 years when his wife, Kathy, was diagnosed with breast cancer. With three young children at home, he took a year off work to nurse her through radiation treatment and chemotherapy.\n\nThis pause from travelling the world to take photos gave him the chance to slow down and consider the impact of of his work.\n\n\"Magazine stories come and go,\" he says.\n\n\"But I had not seen the plight of endangered species getting better so I thought about what I could do to actually make a difference?\"\n\nThe answer came to him while he was photographing a naked mole-rat at a children's zoo in his home town of Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nHe decided to place the small mammal against the white background of a cutting board which he had found in the zoo's kitchen. The result was a professional studio-style portrait.\n\n\"I thought maybe if we do eye-contact, if we photograph animals where there are no distractions, all equal in size on black and white backgrounds, where a mouse is every bit as big and amazing as an elephant, then maybe we could get the public hooked into the plight of endangered species and extinction,\" he says.\n\nAs Sartore's wife recovered, he began to travel to other zoos in his area to take more portraits.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Joel Sartore is an American photographer on a 25 year long wildlife project.\n\nStaff co-operated by helping the photographer create sets, allocating him rooms which he could paint black or white and leaving food inside.\n\n\"Usually the animal thinks he's just coming in to get lunch, which he is, but he's also going to get his picture taken,\" says Sartore.\n\nAs the project grew, it caught the attention of editors at National Geographic, who commissioned Sartore to produce a few series of photographs, on amphibians for example, and America's endangered species.\n\nThe photographer began travelling the world armed with different-sized tents in which to photograph smaller animals like birds and lizards. For the larger ones, he remained reliant on the safer environment of zoos.\n\n\"This animal was the sweetest little guy. He gave us all sorts of different body languages and facial expressions during the shoot. I remember also that he was eating through most of the portrait session as well. So he may look shy, but he was actually very happy at this moment.\" \u00a9 Photo by Joel Sartore/National Geographic Photo Ark\n\n\"Most of the animals I photograph are born and raised in captivity and their keepers know the critters' moods very well,\" he says.\n\n\"Once in a while I'll come across an animal that's really feisty and a bit aggressive, but by and large, these shoots go as smooth as butter.\"\n\nHe has now photographed more than 6,000 species in 40 countries. The project has developed into The National Geographic Photo Ark, and its portraits have made it on to National Geographic Magazine covers and have been projected on to buildings - the UN Building and Empire State Building in New York and the Vatican in Rome.\n\nAn image of \"Toughie\" projected onto St Peter's Basilica \u00a9 Photo by Joel Sartore/National Geographic Photo Ark\n\nSome of the species captured by the Photo Ark are on the verge of extinction.\n\nThis year, Sartore photographed Toughie, the world's last known living Rabbs' fringe-limbed treefrog.\n\nToughie was captured in Panama in 2005 by conservationists attempting to save as many amphibians as possible from chytrid fungus, a skin disease that can have a 100% mortality rate among frogs.\n\nHe was brought back to the Atlanta Botanical Gardens in Georgia where he mated with captured females, but none of his tadpoles survived and his female companions died. Sartore took Toughie's portrait shortly before he also died, in September this year.\n\n\"I try to talk about him every time I give public presentations because instead of getting depressed about him going extinct, I'm going to use his story to hopefully inspire others to care,\" he says.\n\nSartore has also photographed one of the last surviving northern white rhinos in a zoo in the Czech Republic.\n\n\"We got to her just in time,\" he says of the animal, who was called Nabire.\n\n\"We got a very nice portrait of her and she laid down and went to sleep at the end of the shoot because she slept a lot at the end of her life.\"\n\nShe died about a week later.\n\nWith her death, and the death of another northern white rhino in San Diego not long afterwards, there are only three of the species left, all living under armed-guard in Kenya. They are too old to breed, though a conservation project is attempting to create an embryo through IVF which would be implanted in the womb of a similar rhino species.\n\n\"It's not just the little things we're allowing to slip into extinction,\" says Sartore.\n\n\"It's the big stuff too, unfortunately.\"\n\nSartore hopes his project will eventually document 12,000 species and become a resource for future generations. He also hopes it will prevent other species from meeting the same fate as Toughie and Nola.\n\n\"At least 75-80% of the species that I've photographed could be saved from extinction, but people need to know they exist first and they need to fall in love with them and want to learn how they can help them,\" he says.\n\nWhile there's an understanding that bigger animals, like polar bears and tigers, are under threat, Sartore says there is not enough awareness of the plight of smaller ones like rodents, toads and bats.\n\n\"The goal of Photo Ark is to celebrate all creatures great and small and to let people know that as these other species go away, so could we,\" he says.\n\n\"It's in humanity's interest not to throw away all of creation - to keep things around so we have a healthy planet.\"\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.",
