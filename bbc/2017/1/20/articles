            "description": "As Obama moves out the White House, he today also gives up key online real estate - a move already creating controversy.",
            "section": "Technology",
            "content": "President Trump's first tweet on the @POTUS account showed this image\n\nMuch is written about the Herculean effort to move one family out of the White House and a new family in within the space of just a few hours.\n\nBut in our modern age, the digital moving trucks must also roar into action, as prime presidential online real estate gets a makeover, and eight years of President Obama's social media chat is confined to the national archives.\n\nLet\u2019s start with WhiteHouse.gov, the official website for the President, which as of noon Friday, has a brand new look - and has already provoked mild panic.\n\nMany noted that pages about climate change were swiftly deleted. So too were pages about LGBT rights and various science policies.\n\nBut, let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. Pages about everything were deleted as what was essentially Obama\u2019s homepage was replaced with Trump\u2019s.\n\nThat means posts about any former policy positions no longer exist on the White House website if you follow the original links.\n\nSo while the web address pointing to the White House\u2019s position on climate change no longer works, the same can be said about Obama\u2019s pages relating to the economy. Unpredictable as he is, no-one is suggesting Donald Trump is about to describe \u201cmoney\u201d as a hoax.\n\nThat said, on the new whitehouse.gov, a search for \u201cmilitary\u201d will yield 154 results. \u201cClimate change\u201d? None.\n\nNervous internet sleuths have found one reference to climate change, a promise to lift the \"harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the US rules\".\n\nMake of that what you will. People on Twitter certainly are.\n\nAlso wiped clean was the White House's petition website. On Friday, by 4pm in DC, only two petitions were posted on the site. The first demanded the release of the President's tax returns. The other demanded he put his businesses in a blind trust. If either petition gets 100,000 signatures, the White House has to provide a response - at least, that was the rule the previous administration set itself.\n\nTrump reportedly gave up his cell phone upon assuming the presidency\n\nSpeaking of which, it\u2019s all change on Twitter too.\n\nFrom today @POTUS - President of the United States - has been taken over by the Trump team. All previous tweets from Obama\u2019s team - and Obama himself - have been deleted from that account, but archived under @POTUS44. The 44 relating of course to the fact Obama was the 44th US President.\n\nThe tweets were not, as a smattering of people blurted out, \u201cdeleted by Trump\u201d once he had control of the account.\n\nTwitter removed them - and that's because scrubbing the account of Obama\u2019s tweets is a smart move for everyone involved. Had Twitter left the old tweets in place you\u2019ll find yourself seeing people retweeting Obama\u2019s words but with Trump\u2019s identity attached, a recipe for misinformation disaster.\n\nTrump\u2019s first tweet on @POTUS posted a picture and a link to his inaugural address - the full text of which was posted on Facebook. Is Trump having a change of heart over his social network of choice?\n\nMaybe. Facebook certainly offers the chance to speak more clearly at length, and, as the leader of the free world, it would be more useful to post to an audience of almost two billion rather than Twitter\u2019s rather limited 300m.\n\nWe won\u2019t know for sure until about 3am, DC time, tomorrow morning. Everyone will be surely waiting for those twilight hours to see if the President springs back into life posting his thoughts on his own personal account, @realDonaldTrump.\n\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook",

            "description": "US President Donald Trump's inaugural address comes under focus on Saturday's front pages.",
            "section": "The Papers",
            "content": "The papers are dominated by coverage of the US presidential inauguration - with every front page featuring a picture of Donald Trump.\n\nMr Trump, says the Times, unveiled a new era - but it notes that the imagery was unusually dark for an inaugural address, with the president describing crime-ridden inner cities, catastrophic levels of drug addiction, and rusted-out factories.\n\nThe Daily Mirror describes it as a \"chilling inaugural speech\" in which Mr Trump vowed to put the United States first - \"and to hell with every other country\".\n\nThe Daily Mail says it was an incendiary speech, that both electrified and divided his nation.\n\nIt points out the the new president had been expected to finally go easy on the vitriol and enjoy the pomp and ceremony of the event. But it says he used the speech to fire both barrels at the political establishment.\n\nIn the view of the Financial Times, the new president made a defiant and uncompromising address, in which he promised to revive the country with an aggressive rejection of globalisation. The paper says his inauguration marked the end of an incredible journey that was propelled by a groundswell of populism.\n\nThe Sun says more than a billion people watched the swearing in of the new president on TV, with 900,000 spectators on the National Mall in Washington to witness Mr Trump give a thumbs up and fist pump. However the paper notes that the crowd in Washington was only half of that which saw Barack Obama become the first black president in 2009.\n\nWriting in the Guardian, Gary Younge says there was no higher calling, no sense of a greater purpose, and no impassioned idealism. He describes the first words of Mr Trump's presidency as a \"crude and unapologetic appeal to nationalism\".\n\nIn the i, Michael Day describes the address as \"lousy\" and says \"it hardly made the heart soar\".\n\nThe editorials have mixed messages for President Trump.\n\nThe Sun says that now he is in the Oval Office, he may be stunned by the complexity of many of the problems he faces. It notes that plenty of people will write him off - but says that President Reagan was written off too - before he changed the world.\n\nThe Daily Mail claims his speech was \"truly astonishing\" - as he tore up the rule book and delivered an inauguration address unlike any heard before.\n\nThe Daily Express asserts that the progressive left-leaning programme, which seemed woven into Western democracy, is now being unravelled. It says this is a profound change, which will affect us all.\n\nAccording to the Daily Telegraph, the inaugural address was what Mr Trump's supporters had gathered in their thousands to hear. But it says that for outsiders, it was an unsettling speech that seemed to presage the emergence of an inward-looking, isolationist America.\n\nThe Daily Mirror says the US and the rest of the world should be \"very afraid\" following what it describes as the new president's \"rambling, pugnacious and protectionist speech\".\n\nThe Guardian is equally horrified, saying his America First nationalism was both \"crude and shameless\". It concludes the reality of a Trump presidency is a \"terrifying prospect\".\n\nA number of papers also leave space to comment on the person whose day it could have been: Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe Daily Mail says protocol demanded she attended the inauguration with her husband - and her solemn face showed the strain as she arrived at the US Capitol.\n\nThe Daily Express observes the former first lady looked more like she was attending a funeral.\n\nFor the Guardian, Mrs Clinton stood stoically as chants of \"lock her up\" emanated from the crowd. However, on a more positive note, it adds that she left the ceremony waving to supporters and smiling broadly.\n\nFinally - despite their disagreements about President Trump - the papers all seem united on one point.\n\nThe Daily Mirror,Daily Express and the Sun all declare that the stand-out person at Friday's events was the new First Lady, Melania Trump.\n\nMany commentators, including the fashion director of the Daily Telegraph, compare her to Jackie Kennedy.\n\nThe Guardian says she wore a sleek ice blue dress and jacket, which was custom-made by US designer Ralph Lauren.\n\nFor the Daily Mail, she did not put a foot wrong, describing her as the \"dazzling new First Lady\".",

            "section": null,
            "content": "Brilliant centuries from Yuvraj Singh and MS Dhoni gave India a series-clinching 15-run win over England in a thrilling second one-day international.\n\nIndia were reduced to 25-3 in Cuttack before Yuvraj, who struck 150, and Dhoni (134) shared a stand of 256.\n\nThey helped India to 381-6, the third-highest total made against England.\n\nEoin Morgan blasted an 80-ball hundred, Jason Roy, Joe Root and Moeen Ali all made half-centuries, but England ended 366-8 to go 2-0 down with one to play.\n\nThat in itself was England's fifth-highest total and their second of 350 or more in as many games, but they still have not won a series in this country since 1984-85 and have lost 21 of their past 25 ODIs against India in India.\n\nThe tourists looked well set to alter that record when Chris Woakes took three wickets in his first three overs, including the prolific Virat Kohli, but Yuvraj and Dhoni destroyed an England attack that had no control of length.\n\nAn unlikely chase was not out of the question on an ideal batting surface, only for India's spinners to run through the England top order, with the late hitting of Morgan not enough in the face of the home attack's greater nous.\n\nBefore returning for the first match, Yuvraj was out of the India ODI side for more than three years, dropped at the end of a 2013 when he averaged only 19.71 with the bat.\n\nRecalled after some excellent domestic form, he made his first ODI century for six years and his highest score, dismantling the England bowling with stylish drives and brutal pulls.\n\nEngland were right to initially probe the left-hander's historical weakness against the short ball, but too slow to change a plan that did not work.\n\nTime and again short deliveries were dismissed to the leg-side fence, even after Yuvraj had registered his 14th ODI ton with Jake Ball the most persistent offender.\n\nYuvraj successfully overturned a caught-behind decision on 145 and a double century seemed possible until he edged the excellent Woakes, comfortably the pick of England's bowlers, to wicketkeeper Jos Buttler.\n\nDhoni relinquished the white-ball captaincy to Kohli before this series but once again proved his worth alongside the equally experienced Yuvraj - both 35 and with 580 caps between them.\n\nUsually at his best at the end of the innings, Dhoni dealt with the inconvenience of having to arrive in the fifth over by batting until the 48th, initially as a foil for Yuvraj.\n\nHe was dropped on 43, a tough chance to a retreating Ball off a leading edge, and only really accelerated as he neared a century, announcing his intention with a huge six over long-on off Woakes.\n\nFrom there it was carnage, as Dhoni took 41 runs off the last 20 balls he faced. Overall, India hit 214 from their final 20 overs and 120 off the last 10.\n\nLiam Plunkett, ineffective on his return for figures of 2-91, was hammered for three sixes in an over, eventually getting a crumb of comfort when Dhoni hit a full toss to David Willey at deep mid-wicket.\n\nEngland were not fazed by what would have been their highest successful run chase in ODIs, with Root and Roy sharing a stand of 100 that kept the tourists ahead of the curve.\n\nHowever, off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, England's tormentor during their 4-0 Test series defeat, had Root sky a sweep, bowled Ben Stokes and had Buttler stumped down the leg side, while spin partner Ravindra Jadeja found turn to bowl Roy.\n\nStill England pressed on, captain Morgan returning to form with sixes over long-on and long-off, and Moeen's leg-side scoring bringing him a 40-ball half-century.\n\nWhen Moeen dragged on to his stumps off Bhuvneshwar Kumar, it looked to be a fatal blow to England's chances, but Morgan kept them alive in a fifty partnership with Plunkett that came in only 24 balls.\n\nThe Irishman reached his ninth ODI ton only to be run out by bowler Jasprit Bumrah when backing up too far, taking England's hopes with him as he departed.\n\nFalling short by 15 in a game of 747 runs, England will reflect on a bowling effort that was too expensive and top-order batting that failed to capitalise on a strong position.\n\n'India just got too many runs' - analysis\n\nIndia got just too many runs. England's bowling wasn't focused enough on Yuvraj Singh and then they lost wickets at the wrong time.\n\nIt's unfair to blame England's death bowlers, but they still haven't got that right. Woakes is good but they haven't got another person that they can really rely on.\n\u2022 None India's 381-6 is the third-highest score ever made against England in a one-day international.\n\u2022 None The partnership of 256 by Yuvraj Singh and MS Dhoni is the second-highest for any wicket by any opponent against England in ODIs, bettered only by the 286 shared by Sanath Jayasuriya and Upul Tharanga for Sri Lanka in 2006.\n\u2022 None Yuvraj is only the sixth man to make a score of 150 or more against England in an ODI.\n\u2022 None England made their fifth-highest ODI total and their largest batting second. It was also the largest score they have ever made to lose an ODI.\n\u2022 None 747 runs is the second-most made in an ODI in India, behind the 825 made by the hosts and Sri Lanka in 2009-10.\n\u2022 None Joe Root has made a half-century in each of the five Tests and two ODIs against India this winter.\n\n'We weren't at our best' - what they said\n\nEngland captain Eoin Morgan: \"We probably weren't at our best with ball or the bat but we still competed and it's tremendously disappointing not to get over the line.\n\n\"Bowling to MS Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh is very difficult at times. The margin for error is quite small and the challenge is to break the partnership a little earlier.\n\n\"We showed a lot of fight, we have a huge amount of talent. It's been a magnificent day's cricket.\"\n\nIndia captain Virat Kohli: \"I said to the team that if we had had a good start then where could we have ended up today? MS Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh brought stability and wonders to the team, their batting rate was outstanding.\n\n\"A 380 target, we thought, was a bit too far-fetched, but we bowled at the most difficult phase because of the dew and the ball was very hard to execute - and the guys showed great character.\n\n\"If we had not picked out the wickets in the middle then I'm not sure where the game would have gone.\"\n\nMan-of-the-match Yuvraj Singh: \"In the domestic season I've been hitting the ball really well and I've been working hard on my fitness. The results showed today.\n\n\"Me and MS Dhoni understand the situations really well, we started by hitting the ball down the ground really well and not taking any risks. Then we attacked when the time was right.\"\n\n\"Diet has been the key, as you pass 30 you've got to work hard on your fitness - I learned that from Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble, all the greats.\"",

            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Tennis\n\nCoverage: Daily live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra; live text on selected matches on the BBC Sport website; TV highlights on BBC Two and online from 21 January.\n\nDan Evans joined Andy Murray in the last 16 of the Australian Open with a brilliant performance to give Britain two men in the fourth round.\n\nTop seed Murray made short work of American Sam Querrey, winning 6-4 6-2 6-4 in one hour and 59 minutes.\n\nEvans, the world number 51, then upset Australian 27th seed Bernard Tomic with a 6-3 7-6 (7-2) 7-6 (7-3) victory.\n\nIt is the first time Evans has made a Grand Slam fourth round, and he next faces 12th seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.\n\u2022 None Feature: Has Djokovic's desire burned itself out?\n\u2022 None How to follow the Australian Open on the BBC\n\nQuerrey was the man who upset then world number one Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon last summer, but Murray made sure he did not fall victim to another shock after the Serb's surprise defeat by Denis Istomin on Thursday.\n\nWith six-time champion Djokovic out, Murray is a clear favourite among many observers to finally land the third leg of the career Grand Slam.\n\n\"I don't worry about that, really,\" said Murray, who has lost four Melbourne finals to Djokovic.\n\n\"Obviously, if you're to get to the final, then it has an effect. A lot of the times when I've been in the final here, I've played against him. Had some tough ones.\"\n\u2022 None Andy Murray column: Everyone needs to give Djokovic a break\n\nQuerrey gave the Scot plenty to think about in the early stages of their third-round match, attacking the net and hurrying the top seed, but a first-serve percentage of just 57% was not enough to keep Murray at bay.\n\nThe American missed a fleeting chance with a break point in game eight and Murray immediately took advantage, getting the break himself in the next game with a beautiful lob.\n\nHe took a firm grip on the match with a run of six out of seven games, easing through the second set with two more breaks.\n\nThere was a flurry of resistance as Querrey reeled off three straight games to lead 3-2 in the third set, but Murray once again turned up the pressure with his return to break for a fifth time on his way to a comprehensive victory.\n\n\"Sam, especially in the first set, was hitting a huge ball,\" added Murray, who had no problem with the ankle he turned during his previous match.\n\n\"There was a key moment at 3-4 when I saved a break point and then managed to break the next game and had the momentum after that.\"\n\nBritish number three Evans is set to move inside the world's top 50, with 180 ranking points already secured in Melbourne, plus at least \u00a3135,000 in prize money.\n\nAfter failing to convert a match point against Stan Wawrinka in the third round of last year's US Open, the 26-year-old from Solihull grabbed this opportunity with both hands.\n\n\"It was tough, Bernard is difficult,\" said Evans. \"He is unorthodox and I found it hard at the start. I am happy to come through in three tight sets. It could have gone either way.\"\n\nEvans followed the best win of his career over seventh seed Marin Cilic on Wednesday with another terrific performance, setting the pace and holding firm when under pressure late in the second and third sets.\n\nHe was broken after holding two set points on serve in the second set but recovered superbly when facing two set points two games later, then raced through the tie-break with some brilliant all-court tennis.\n\nWhen Tomic threatened again late in the third set, Evans fought off another three break points with some magnificent play that even drew applause from his opponent.\n\nThere were worrying signs of possible cramp, and a brief rain shower came to the Briton's aid when serving at 5-5, 40-40, allowing him to recuperate and dominate a second tie-break to clinch the win.\n\nEvans, who is without a clothing sponsor, has been buying his own T-shirts in Melbourne.\n\n\"I am happy with them at the minute,\" he said. \"One shrunk in the wash so I had to change it, but I reckon they look all right.\"\n\nMurray will start as a strong favourite against Zverev, but there is plenty of danger lurking on the Scot's side of the draw.\n\nFormer winner Stan Wawrinka, the US Open champion, is through to the last 16 after a 3-6 6-2 6-2 7-6 (9-7) win over Serbia's Viktor Troicki.\n\nThe Swiss, a potential semi-final opponent for Murray, will play Andreas Seppi next after the Italian beat Belgian Steve Darcis 4-6 6-4 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-2).\n\nShould Murray get past Zverev on Saturday he will face a daunting quarter-final against four-time champion Roger Federer or fifth seed Kei Nishikori.\n\nIn two of his previous Grand Slams, Evans had come tantalisingly close to breaking into the fourth round - especially at the US Open last September, when he had match point to knock out eventual champion Stan Wawrinka.\n\nAgainst Tomic, he looked from the first point as if he believed this was a match he was going to win. The third set in particular was very physical, as the Australian dragged Evans around the court, and yet he was still fresh enough to win the tie-break in convincing manner.\n\nEvans will be a top-50 player for the first time after the Australian Open - some rise from the position of 772 he found himself in just 20 months ago. Perhaps hitting his mid-20s and developing a taste for the big occasion from Davis Cup ties spurred him to commit to the ceaseless dedication, and long spells away from home, required to be a top player.\n\nEvans should be at his peak over the next four years. With help from his coach Mark Hilton, he has built the foundations to allow this not to be as good as it gets.",

            "content": "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The Marching Tornado Band has travelled all the way from Alabama.\n\nThe only marching band from a historically black college to perform at the Trump presidential inauguration has experienced intense backlash. Regardless, on Thursday morning, the Talladega Marching Tornadoes blew into Washington.\n\nWhen students awoke after the 19-hour bus trip from Talladega, Alabama, one of the first scenes that greeted their bleary eyes in the nation's capital was Senator Bernie Sanders, waiting to cross the street.\n\nIt was a sight few of the Talladega College marching band members thought they'd ever see - a former presidential candidate strolling to work - as the vast majority had never even been outside the state of Alabama.\n\n\"They're so talented, these young people. We're really excited to give them this opportunity,\" said Dr Sharon Whittaker-Davis, the school's vice-president of student affairs, as she watched the students pour out of the buses and into the African American Civil War Museum in Washington. \"We're here.\"\n\nAfter 19 hours on the bus from Talladega, Alabama, the Marching Tornadoes arrive in Washington\n\nThe night before, the mayor of tiny Talladega and a crowd of about 100 well-wishers cheered as the buses pulled out of town. It was a loving send-off that contrasted sharply with the treatment the band had faced in previous weeks.\n\nSeveral other high schools and colleges, including historically black institutions like Howard University, declined the invitation or didn't even apply to play at Donald Trump's inauguration.\n\nAs soon as it was announced that the Marching Tornadoes was the sole black college to accept, they were called sell-outs, race traitors and worse.\n\nThe college president received demands for his resignation, and then death threats. Alumni begged their alma mater not to go.\n\n\"Please do not march in this. Stand with people of colour against racism,\" one comment read on the band's Facebook page.\n\nHowever, after college president Barry Hawkins appeared on Fox News to explain his decision to let the band perform, donations to a GoFundMe page raising money for the trip shot through the roof, soaring to almost $650,000 (\u00a3527,000).\n\nThe extra money will go towards scholarships, new band uniforms, new instruments and a new practice space - the college has only 700 students, almost all of whom receive some type of financial aid.\n\nOmarosa Manigault, Donald Trump's director of communications, take selfies with the Talladega Tornadoes\n\nMany of the band members come from low-income backgrounds and are the first in their families to attend college.\n\nThe students were eager about the invitation and took the ensuing backlash personally.\n\n\"I just couldn't understand why they would do that to us,\" said 21-year-old alto saxophone player Eriel House.\n\n\"We're students. We're not involved in a political party. We just wanted to go show our talents.\"\n\n\"[He's president] regardless,\" said Shylexis Robinson. \"I just want to march on Pennsylvania Avenue, period.\"\n\nOnce in Washington, the trip organisers had hoped to take the students straight to the Martin Luther King Memorial on the National Mall.\n\nBut because streets were already blocked off for the inauguration, they instead headed to the African American Civil War Museum - a tribute to the black soldiers who fought for the Union.\n\nTalladega College itself was founded in 1867 by the descendants of slaves.\n\nStudents took selfies in front of a monument to black soldiers who fought for the Union in the Civil War\n\nInside the darkened museum, the students swished around in their matching blue-and-crimson tracksuits, peering into display cases of rusty slaves' shackles, a yellowed 1862 copy of the New York Times announcing the \"preliminary emancipation\" of slaves, and a sign that reads: \"We Serve Colored Carry Out Only\".\n\nWhen Mr Hawkins announced to the group that a special guest awaited the students across the street, a student said: \"Obama?\"\n\nInstead, Omarosa Manigault - former Apprentice star, director of Mr Trump's African-American outreach during the campaign, and now his director of communications - waited beside a statue of four black Union soldiers.\n\n\"You have shown and exhibited such great courage... we can't move forward unless we are together,\" Ms Manigault called out.\n\n\"On behalf of the president, Donald J Trump, I want to just thank you, welcome you here and I cannot wait to see y'all show up and show out tomorrow at the inauguration parade!\"\n\nMilling around the memorial, Melissa Harris traced her hand along the names inscribed on the monument.\n\n\"I think I found one of my ancestors on one of these walls,\" she said.\n\n\"I hope we get to meet President Obama,\" another girl sighed.\n\n\"I don't think it's hitting us yet that he's going,\" said Marissa Melchor quietly.\n\n\"He's not dying,\" her friend said rolling her eyes.\n\n\"It feels unreal,\" Ms Melchor replied. \"But reality is going to hit us.\"\n\nElkena Washington on the E-flat alto saxophone and Melissa Harris on piccolo\n\nThe students piled back onto the buses and took a long, slow ride through packed traffic to the University of the District of Columbia campus.\n\nThere the students got their first meal since the previous day, and listened to remarks from local business people who donated to their GoFundMe campaign.\n\nNone of the students who spoke to BBC News expressed a strong support for incoming President Trump, but they seemed cautiously optimistic.\n\n\"I don't like everything about him. I think it's going to be a pretty interesting couple of years,\" said Bernard Norris, an 18-year-old trombone player.\n\n\"I just wish him the best of luck and I hope he does the country right... I hope something good comes out of this.\"\n\nIn the hallway outside the dining hall, 21-year-old first chair trumpeteer Marco Vera said that even though he is excited to perform, it was hard to hear some of the remarks Mr Trump made during the campaign.\n\n\"Coming from a Hispanic background, having to see my parents struggle through everything to get where we're at... it hurts,\" he said.\n\n\"Yeah, he said some stuff about us, but I'm performing for my college. I'm performing for my parents. My parents told me to go out there and showcase my talent... so I'm just going to go out there and make my family proud.\"\n\nThe Marching Tornadoes on Friday morning, just before they departed for the Pentagon",

            "description": "Hong Kong has spent 20 years under Chinese sovereignty. What's changed?",
            "section": "China",
            "content": "This year marks the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from the UK to China. The BBC's Helier Cheung, who sang in the handover ceremony, shares her personal reflections on the last two decades.\n\nAs a child, you don't always appreciate when you're witnessing history.\n\nOn 1 July 1997, I was part of the choir singing in the handover, in front of China's leaders and millions of viewers around the world.\n\nIt was a historic day. But I was nine at the time, so my most vivid memories were:\n\nAll of us in the choir had grown up speaking Cantonese. So singing in Mandarin felt both familiar and unfamiliar - it signified a culture we recognised, but did not grow up with.\n\nIn 1997, I (second from left) got to sing in the handover ceremony\n\nNearly 20 years later, I was back in Hong Kong reporting for the BBC\n\nThere were lots of dancers with pink fans, and I remember China's then-President Jiang Zemin holding up a piece of calligraphy that read \"Hong Kong's tomorrow will be better\".\n\nBut that night, I saw on TV that some had been protesting against the handover. It was one of my first lessons about Hong Kong's divisions - some were happy to be part of China again, but others were afraid.\n\nI didn't always follow politics then, but politics still affected me. Some of my friends emigrated ahead of the handover, because their parents weren't sure about life under China.\n\nAnd 1997 was also the start of the Asian financial crisis, so I overheard adults talking about stock market crashes, and suicides.\n\nAs a child, it was more comforting to be oblivious about the news.\n\nEven as my friends and I went to secondary school, we rarely thought about developments in mainland China - we were teenagers after all.\n\nThis all changed in 2003. Hong Kong was hit by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) which travelled over from southern China.\n\nPeople started wearing face masks to protect themselves from Sars\n\nSuddenly whole buildings were being quarantined. School was cancelled - shortly before our exams - as well as our junior high ball.\n\nTo some, it almost seemed unfair - the virus had spread here after officials in mainland China covered up the outbreak.\n\nYet Hong Kong, which handled the outbreak more transparently, was the focus of a lot of international coverage, and was the city with the most deaths - nearly 300.\n\nMy friends and I became more pragmatic. We did everything we were told to - wearing face masks, disinfecting our hands and taking our temperatures before school each day.\n\nBut we kept meeting up in McDonald's after class, as we always did. One friend told me: \"If you die, you die, there's nothing you can do. You just need to do the best you can.\"\n\nBy summertime, Hong Kong was Sars-free. But another crisis, this time political, was rumbling.\n\nThe government wanted to introduce national security legislation, known as Article 23.\n\nIt would have outlawed treason, secession and sedition - words I had to look up - and allowed our government to outlaw groups banned in mainland China.\n\nThe bill struck a nerve. Although many countries outlaw treason and secession, to many Hong Kongers it reminded them too much of mainland China.\n\nOn 1 July 2003, half a million people, including some of my classmates, marched against the bill.\n\nA few days later, the government was forced to shelve Article 23, after one of its political allies, a pro-business party, withdrew its support.\n\nMy friends were jubilant, telling me they had \"made history\". Many felt that, although there was no democracy, it was possible to vote with their feet.\n\nMany people wore black to show their opposition to Article 23\n\nThe Sars outbreak and Article 23 row made local and Chinese politics seem more relevant to our daily lives.\n\nAnd by the late 2000s, mainland China felt more entwined with Hong Kong than ever.\n\nWhen I was a child, some of my classmates, somewhat cruelly, mocked \"mainlanders\" as people who squatted and were poor. But now, more people were learning Mandarin, and Hong Kong's economic future seemed to depend on China's.\n\nChina loosened travel restrictions, making it easier for mainland tourists to visit Hong Kong.\n\nIt gave the economy a much-needed boost, but resentment was also growing.\n\nI was studying abroad by then, but whenever I flew home I would hear people gripe about the sheer number of tourists, and how rude some appeared.\n\nMainlanders' shopping trips to Hong Kong have been a source of irritation to people in the city\n\nSome tourists bought up huge quantities of baby milk powder, leaving local parents without enough.\n\nI could no longer recognise many of the shopping malls my school friends and I used to frequent. We grew up with cheap jewellery stalls and snack shops - but now shopping centres were dominated by designer brands that wealthy Chinese tourists preferred.\n\nThe other big change was in politics. When I was at school, expressing an interest in politics was more likely to get you teased than admired.\n\nBut by 2012, students were holding hunger strikes to oppose a government attempt to introduce \"patriotic education\" classes.\n\nAnd in 2014, something surprising, almost unthinkable, happened. Tens of thousands of people, led by students, took over the streets, demanding full democracy.\n\nGrowing up, it was easy to avoid talking about politics.\n\nBut with protesters sleeping in the streets for weeks, the subject was suddenly unavoidable.\n\nFamilies and friends started arguing - in person and on Facebook - and \"unfriending\" people they disagreed with.\n\nSupporters felt it was worth sacrificing order and economic growth for true democracy, but critics accused the protesters of \"destroying\" Hong Kong.\n\nOne woman told me her relatives were angry she took part in the protests and now, two years later, they still didn't want to meet her for dinner. \"Hong Kong's become so split,\" she said.\n\nHong Kong was split between \"yellow ribbons\" who supported the protesters, and \"blue ribbons\" who supported the police\n\nRecently, after years in the UK, I got to return to Hong Kong as a reporter.\n\nA lot feels the same. The territory is still clean, efficient, and obsessed with good food.\n\nBut young people seem more pessimistic - with politics and soaring house prices their main bugbears.\n\nSurveys suggest young people are the unhappiest they have been in a decade - and that up to 60% want to leave.\n\nRecently, some have even started to call for independence from China, frustrated with Beijing's influence and the lack of political reform.\n\nTheir resentment stems from Hong Kong's handover or even the Sino-British negotiations in the 1980s.\n\n\"We were never given a choice,\" one activist said. \"No-one ever asked Hong Kongers what they wanted.\"\n\nProtests have become angrier. Most demonstrations I witnessed growing up were peaceful - even festive.\n\nNow, some rallies are more confrontational and prone to clashes, while the government seems less willing to make concessions.\n\nPro-Beijing and pro-democracy protesters sometimes end up clashing\n\nIt's not surprising that, in an online poll run by a pro-government party, people chose \"chaos\" as the word to describe Hong Kong's 2016.\n\nFrom violent protests, to legislators swearing and scuffling in parliament, politics has definitely been chaotic at times.\n\nBut, chaotic or not, what really strikes me about Hong Kong is how alive and adaptable it is.\n\nHong Kong's streets are busy late into the night\n\nWhether in business or politics, Hong Kong is full of people fighting to be heard.\n\nLocal entrepreneurs are constantly devising controversial or creative ways to make money - such as renting out \"capsule units\" in their homes, or starting a rabbit cafe.\n\nAnd, even as artists complain of pressure to self-censor, pop music has become more political and fresh news websites and satirical news channels have popped up.\n\nHong Kong may be a relatively small territory with a population of 7.3 million, but I love the fact it has never lost its ability to surprise me.\n\nHelier Cheung's report can also be heard on From Our Own Correspondent",

            "description": "Might the search for missing airliner MH370 resume, and if so who would pay for it?",
            "section": "Asia",
            "content": "Many distraught relatives have called for the search to continue\n\nThe announcement on 17 January that the search for MH370 was being suspended should have surprised no-one.\n\nAt the tripartite meeting last July of the three countries involved in the search, Malaysia, Australia and China, they agreed that it would not be continued beyond the current 120,000sq km area (46,332 sq miles) of the southern Indian Ocean, unless there was credible new information showing a specific location for the crashed airliner.\n\nNonetheless the families of the victims have condemned this requirement for a \"precise location\", calling it \"at best an erroneous expectation, and at worst a clever formulation to bury the search\".\n\nThey have pointed to a statement in December by the Australian Transport Safety Board, which is leading the search operation, that in view of the drift modelling carried out by the Australian scientific organisation CSIRO for debris from MH370 found along the East African coast, there was \"strong evidence that the aircraft is most likely to be located to the north of the current indicative underwater search area\".\n\nAnd with no trace of the airliner found after an exhaustive two-and-a-half-year search, all the experts agree they have been looking in the wrong area.\n\nThere were 14 nationalities among the 227 passengers and 12 crew on board the plane\n\nThe CSIRO drift models suggest the search should be shifted to a 25,000sq km area immediately north of the existing zone, along the arc that satellite data shows the plane must have travelled. It might require an additional $40-50m to extend the search operation into the new area, on top of the $160m already spent.\n\nBut the three governments appear unmoved, sticking rigidly to the formula they agreed last July, although the Australian and Malaysian governments insist cost is not a factor in their decision to stop searching.\n\nHowever in an interview with ABC News on Tuesday, Australian Transport Minister Darren Chester made the point that any decision to resume the search was \"primarily Malaysia's call\".\n\nThat underlines a problem which has troubled the search operation from the start: who is really responsible?\n\nBack in February 2015 Australia submitted a request to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which regulates international air travel, for clearer guidelines on which country should be responsible for both organising and funding an extended search operation.\n\nUnder existing guidelines Australia is responsible for initial search-and-rescue efforts in the vast areas of ocean off its western coast. But once it was clear there would be no survivors, it became a search-and-recovery operation, for which responsibility is not clear.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe ICAO designates to Malaysia, the flag state of the missing plane, the task of leading the accident investigation, but it is not clear whether that includes running the extended search.\n\nThis was important because by 2015 Australia had shouldered most of the financial burden, and people were beginning to complain. After all, the specialised ships and detection equipment used in the search had to be rented from a Dutch salvage company; any of the three countries could have covered this cost.\n\nOnly six of the MH370 passengers were Australians, whereas 153 came from China, which has so far contributed relatively little, around $16m, although the ICAO imposes no requirement on it do so. The Malaysian government now says it has contributed a total of $112m, but the official Australian figures suggest it has actually spent less than that.\n\nSo why does Malaysia not take the initiative to fund an extended search? The Malaysian Transport Ministry responded to this question with the formula from last July, that all three countries had agreed they first needed indications of a specific location for the crash site, despite that fact that such detailed information in a huge expanse of sea is extremely unlikely to be found.\n\nPieces probably from the plane have been found as far away as Madagascar\n\nRelatives of the passengers have also criticised the Malaysian authorities for being so slow to request recovered pieces of debris, eight of which are now believed to be almost certainly from the missing airliner.\n\nThat debris is important: it has not only helped ascertain a probable alternative location for the plane; it has also helped confirm how the aircraft ended its flight, with Australian investigators concluding that it plunged into the sea, and was not under the control of the pilot.\n\nMalaysia has at times given the impression of being a reluctant lead investigator, happy for Australia to do most of the legwork.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Grace Subathirai Nathan: \"I want to know what happened to my mother\"\n\nAviation expert Geoffrey Thomas describes Malaysia's approach as \"inexcusable and irresponsible. It is their plane, and their responsibility to find out what happened to it. They are walking away from their commitment to international aviation and the flying public\".\n\nThe Malaysian Ministry of Transport says only that \"all decisions with regards to the MH370 search have and will always be in the spirit of tripartite co-operation.\"\n\nIf it is primarily Malaysia's call to restart the search operation, it looks unlikely to make it.",
