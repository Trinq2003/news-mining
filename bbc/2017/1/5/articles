LG unveiled its \"wallpaper TV' at the CES tech show in Las Vegas\n\nSouth Korean tech giants LG and Samsung have launched TVs that aim to better blend in to consumers' living rooms.\n\nLG showed off a set that can be fitted almost flat against a wall while Samsung teased a new kind of TV - designed to look like a painting - that displays art when not in use.\n\nSamsung also unveiled a flagship set boasting greater brightness levels than before.\n\nOthers, including Sony, also revealed new models.\n\nSamsung's flagship 75in (190cm) QLED 4K TV features the latest version of its quantum dot technology - tiny particles that emit different colours of light. These now feature a metal material that the firm says allows for better colour reproduction.\n\nSamsung has decided to stick with a curved display for its high-end models - despite criticism from some experts that viewing angles suffer with such designs.\n\nSamsung's quantum dots are tiny particles that emit light of different colours\n\nThe QLED TV can achieve HDR (high dynamic range) brightness of between 1,500 and 2,000 nits - one nit equalling the light from a candle.\n\n\"It's insanely bright,\" said Jack Wetherill, a tech analyst at Futuresource.\n\n\"That is pretty power hungry one would imagine, but if they're going down the route of getting as good a picture as they can out of it, then fair enough.\"\n\nThis sets it apart from other set makers who use another premium TV screen technology, OLED (organic light-emitting diode).\n\nSuch screens use a carbon-based film allowing the panel to emit its own light, rather than being backlit - this enables the ultra thin designs.\n\nQuantum dot TVs might not be able to display the deepest blacks possible with OLED, but they are generally brighter.\n\nLG's newest TV sticks out just 3.85mm from a wall when mounted against it\n\nLG's new OLED 4K TV was as thin as last year's - just 2.57mm thick - and will be available in 65 and 77in models.\n\nBut the firm has now designed a new mount that uses magnets so the set can be fixed flat against a wall, which the firm says means it doesn't cast \"a single shadow\".\n\nLG also announced its latest TVs would support four HDR formats - including Hybrid Log-Gamma jointly developed by the BBC and the Japanese broadcaster NHK. This will allow sport and other live broadcasts to be shown in the format.\n\nMany experts agree that HDR makes a huge difference to the TV picture, making it seem richer and allowing for higher levels of contrast between light and dark tones.\n\n\"It is more vibrant, the colours are more distinctive,\" said Mr Wetherill.\n\n\"It does bring a much more impressive and immersive experience - no question about that.\"\n\nIt is not yet clear which format will become popular with content-makers, so LG's inclusion of all four should ensure it does not become obsolete if and when a winner emerges.\n\nThe Samsung Lifestyle TV could be mistaken for a painting\n\nSamsung also showed off images of its new Lifestyle TV, which it described as \"a beautiful, always-on, truly smart display that transforms the TV to art\".\n\nIt comes in a wooden frame, in an attempt to look like a painting.\n\nSony also announced a new 4K OLED TV - its first - the latest in its Bravia range.\n\nAs well as an HDR processor that can upscale standard dynamic range content to \"near 4K HDR quality\", the set has also dispensed with in-built speakers.\n\nInstead, it emits sound via vibrations produced on the surface of the screen itself.\n\nThe new Bravia TV doesn't have speakers - the screen vibrates instead, which emits sounds\n\nThis wasn't demonstrated at the press conference, noted Mr Wetherill, but it was, he said, \"an interesting concept\".\n\nPanasonic did not discuss its OLED TV plans at its press conference, though it is possible a prototype will be on the CES trade show floor.\n\nAt last year's consumer electronics show IFA in Berlin, the company had said it would release details of the TV during the winter.\n\nFollow all our CES coverage at bbc.co.uk/ces2017\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "content": "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. CitizenAID aims to help the public save lives before the professionals arrive\n\nPeople need to learn lifesaving skills in case they are caught up in a terror attack in the UK, a team of senior military and civilian medics has said.\n\nThey say people need to know how to help each other because it could take some time before it is deemed safe for paramedics to arrive on the scene.\n\nThe idea is supported by counter-terrorism police. Security services say a UK terror attack is highly likely.\n\nAlthough an individual's chance of being caught up in an incident is small, Brig Tim Hodgetts and Prof Sir Keith Porter, co-developers of CitizenAID, say it is a good idea for people to have a plan and the knowledge and skills to help each other.\n\nTheir app, pocket book and website suggest how best to deal with injuries in the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting or bombing incident.\n\nThe system includes instructions on how to treat severe bleeding - one of the major causes of death in these scenarios.\n\nIt guides people through packing, putting pressure on and elevating a wound, and how to use a tourniquet safely, for example.\n\nThe programme also explains how to prioritise those who need treatment first and what to tell the emergency services once they arrive.\n\nCitizenAID is not a government initiative but its developers say it builds on national advice from national counter-terrorism police to:\n\nThe system describes how to make a tourniquet out of a scarf to help stop bleeding\n\nThe CitizenAID system says people should follow these steps and then go one step further. It suggests once people are safe, they should start treating casualties.\n\nCh Insp Richard Harding, head of the National Counter Terrorism Security Office, told the BBC: \"One of the challenges we have is that when a serious incident, particularly a terrorist incident occurs, the first responders from a police perspective to a terrorist incident will inevitably be trying to deal with the people causing the threat.\n\n\"They won't have time to deal with the people who are injured and that gap is vital to saving people's lives.\n\n\"So we are really interested in the concept of CitizenAID. It allows the public and people involved in very rare incidents like this to help themselves and help others and their loved ones survive the situation.\"\n\nAccording to its founders, CitizenAID builds on lessons learnt on the battlefield.\n\nSir Keith Porter, professor of clinical traumatology at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, told the BBC: \"I have treated hundreds of soldiers whose lives have been saved by simply the applications of tourniquets when they have been shot or blown up. Teaching individual soldiers these skills has saved lives.\n\n\"And I think it is essential we train the public in those skills and that is exactly what CitizenAID does.\"\n\nBrig Tim Hodgetts, medical director of the Defence Medical Services, told the BBC; \"We don't know when the next incident will be that will involve blasts or gunshots so we need a critical mass of the general public to learn these first aid skills.\n\n\"They are the people who are always going to be at the scene. They are the ones who are going to make a difference.\"\n\nHe added: \"I think we are doing the opposite of scaring the public, we are empowering the public.\n\n''By giving them a step-by-step system we take away the anxiety because the decisions are already made and the right decisions in the right order can save lives.\"\n\nThe app is free to download and the pocketbook costs \u00a31.99 to order.\n\nSue Killen, of St John Ambulance, added \"First aid can be the difference between life and death. Knowing basic first aid in a terror attack or in an everyday emergency at home or in the community, will give you more confidence to deal with a crisis.\n\n\"First aid is easy to learn and our first aid techniques cover a wide range of injuries that could occur in a terrorist incident including severe bleeding, crush injuries and shock.\n\n\"We encourage anyone who would like to learn first aid to go to our website to view our first aid videos, download our app or attend a first aid course.\"\n\nWhat do you think?

            "content": "As Cuba slowly opens up its economy to the rest of the world, more and more Cubans are learning English. The Cuban government has made proficiency in English a requirement for all high school and university students. As Will Grant reports from Havana, that approach differs from the Cold War, when Russian was the preferred foreign language.\n\nAt the annual Havana Jazz Festival, the audience members, much like the music, were a mix of international and Cuban.\n\nSitting on plastic chairs at the open-air venue, visitors from the United States, Europe and China mingled with local jazz aficionados.\n\nOn stage, a saxophonist who lives in Denmark was reunited with some old Cuban friends.\n\nAt such an international event, the common language is generally English.\n\nMany Cubans are already learning the language themselves, and if not, they are trying to make sure their children are.\n\nMorning assembly at Jesus Suarez Gayol Secondary School on the outskirts of Havana begins with the school's anthem.\n\nSecondary school pupils are expected to reach a certain standard in English\n\nThe school is named after one of the guerrillas who fought alongside Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara but these teenagers are growing up in an increasingly different Cuba to the one Jesus Suarez did.\n\nFor a start, a certain proficiency in English is now a requirement for all secondary school children and university graduates.\n\nDuring the Cold War, students could choose between learning English and Russian but Cuba's educational authorities told the BBC they now consider English a necessary skill for all of the nation's youth.\n\n\"As an international language, English has always had a place in our curriculum,\" says Director of Secondary Education Zoe de la Red Iturria.\n\n\"But we are now rolling out new techniques to evolve our learning of the English language,\" she adds.\n\nZoe de la Red Iturria wants to modernise English-language learning in Cuba\n\nBut language-teaching methods remain quite traditional, relying heavily on textbooks, parrot-fashion repetition and with only very limited Internet access.\n\nOlga Perez, national adviser for English teaching in Cuba, says the authorities are hoping to tackle that last issue.\n\n\"It would be very good for us if we had the internet in the schools. And we hope that in the future, we'll not only have the internet, we're also dreaming of installing language laboratories in every school.\"\n\nAnd it is not just in the classrooms that English can be heard more frequently but on the streets of Havana, too.\n\nIn what was a record year for tourism to Cuba, many Cubans have tried to teach themselves English without the help of any formal classes.\n\nDarvis Luis sells second-hand books and posters to tourists. He says he learnt English entirely through computer games, music videos and rock songs.\n\n\"I have to make conversation because I need to make money to eat,\" he says in easy-flowing, fast English.\n\n\"I have to learn how to speak with them and I have to get better and better. I tell them a story because books aren't so easy to sell. So you have to make them believe in what you're saying.\"\n\nDarvis Luis taught himself English to be able to better sells his second-hand books to tourists\n\nResources for Anglophiles and budding English-language students like Darvis Luis are limited in Cuba.\n\nOne place they can go is Cuba Libro, the island's only English-language bookstore.\n\nNestled in the leafy Havana district of Vedado, it is the brainchild of US healthcare journalist and long-time Havana resident Conner Gorry.\n\nMs Gorry says that after some initial misgivings, local residents \"welcomed us with open arms\" once they saw \"the free cultural programming, high-quality literature and community outreach\" on offer.\n\n\"Literature is not subversive,\" she says. \"A Cuban government-run publishing house just published George Orwell's 1984 and that's available in state-run bookstores.\"\n\n\"With increased tourism and increased business connections to the wider world, the Cubans are encouraging people to learn English. So we've become a resource,\" she adds.\n\nIn the past months, as well as the jazz festival, Havana has hosted the annual film festival and the international ballet festival.\n\nThe Latin American Film Festival has drawn Cubans and tourists to Havana\n\nIt is at events like these that the thaw in relations with the US seems clearer than ever.\n\nThe decision by the Obama Administration and the Castro government to rebuild their diplomatic ties has undeniably brought Cubans and Americans closer together.\n\nIt has also brought about some potentially lasting collaboration in science and the arts.\n\nThere are people on both sides who fear those steps could soon be reversed, especially in light of comments made to that effect by President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nFor now though, the young students at Jesus Suarez are just keen to keep improving their ability to communicate with the rest of the world.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Donald Trump is not popular in Mexico\n\nMexico is being blamed by President-elect Donald Trump for taking jobs from the US.\n\nHe's been putting pressure on US companies not to move jobs south, and this week Ford announced it was investing in its factory in Michigan rather than building a new plant in Mexico.\n\nDuring his election campaign, Mr Trump threatened to rip up Nafta, the free trade agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico, which has been in place for 23 years.\n\nBut what impact has Nafta had in Mexico, and what would its potential demise mean for the country?\n\nIn a leafy square in Mexico City on a warm December evening a group of excited children are hitting a brightly coloured pinata stuffed with sweets. A fellow passer-by explains to me that pinatas are a Mexican tradition, particularly at Christmas and birthdays.\n\nHowever, Mexicans also like pinatas \"in the shape of everything we want to hit\", he says. \"The latest trend is Donald Trump pinatas,\" he adds.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. A look back at some of the things Donald Trump has said about Mexicans\n\nMr Trump is not popular in Mexico. He was incredibly rude about Mexicans during his election campaign, and at a time when the world seems to be turning away from free trade he threatened to end the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) between the US, Mexico and Canada.\n\nThe important thing about Nafta is that companies importing and exporting between the three countries pay no tariffs. Mr Trump believes it's been bad for the US as cheaper Mexican labour has meant some US manufacturers have moved production across the border, resulting in job losses at home.\n\nNafta was implemented in 1994 and over the past 23 years Mexico has grown as a manufacturing hub. Today the United States and Mexico trade over $500bn (\u00a3400bn) in goods and services a year, equal to about $1.5bn a day. Mexico is the US's second-biggest export market, and the US is Mexico's largest.\n\nThierry Legros says without Nafta his farming business would be under threat\n\nRed Sun Farms, a large vegetable-growing firm in central Mexico, depends on the free trade agreement. Its managing director, Thierry Legros, shows me into a vast greenhouse, 200m long, with row upon row of tomato plants. The company also grows peppers and exports 90% of its crop to the US and Canada.\n\nSo what would it mean if Mr Trump repealed the Nafta agreement completely with its tariff-free trading? \"We might need to close the whole company,\" Thierry tells me. \"It would be around 3,000 direct jobs, so with all the indirect that's quite a lot, probably double that.\"\n\nOutside Thierry's office three flags flutter in the wind - one for each Nafta country.\n\nThe three Nafta flags at Red Sun Farms reflect the company's integration within the free trade area\n\nRed Sun Farms even owns a farm in the US and sends Mexican workers over there. However, there's a stark wage differential, with pay significantly higher in the US.\n\n\"Right now with the exchange rate that's huge,\" Thierry explains, \"it's about one to eight, one to 10.\"\n\nThese Red Sun Farms workers in Mexico earn far less than their counterparts in the US\n\nAs well as enabling Mexico to export freely, Nafta also opened the door to US imports, giving Mexican consumers much greater choice.\n\n\"It was an achievement, it was against history,\" says economic consultant Luis de la Calle, who was one of the negotiators of the free trade agreement.\n\n\"Most Mexicans thought that it was impossible or not convenient to have a strategic association with the US, and many people in the US never thought that Mexico could be their partner.\"\n\nYou can listen to In Business: Mexico and Mr Trump on BBC Radio 4 at 20:30 GMT on Thursday, 5 January and at 21:30 GMT on Sunday, 8 January.\n\nIncreased demand, as a result of free trade, forced Mexican manufacturers to improve quality.\n\nLuis de la Calle says that before Nafta Mexico had three producers of TV sets, and the quality was \"awful\". But today, Mexico is \"the largest manufacturer of TV sets in the world\". They are exported and are \"high quality, completely different from the protected market we had before\".\n\nThe instantly recognisable VW Beetles are manufactured in Puebla, Mexico\n\nMexico is now a centre of manufacturing for overseas companies, such as the motor industry. General Motors and Ford both have factories in Mexico as well as the US.\n\nBut Donald Trump has put public pressure on US companies not to move production, and has threatened to impose import duties on cars coming in from Mexico. It's a sensitive subject and the American carmakers refused to be interviewed.\n\nDonald Trump had this message for the car industry earlier this week\n\nHowever, in the city of Puebla, a two-hour drive from the capital, the German car manufacturer Volkswagen is the biggest employer with 14,000 staff. It's the only place in the world where VW produces its famous Beetle, and as you enter the site you're greeted by a display of Beetles suspended in the air like a piece of installation art. The Golf and Jetta models are also produced here.\n\nThomas Karig from VW Mexico was tight-lipped about whether the firm had come under any pressure about jobs\n\nLike the US carmakers, Volkswagen's Mexican production is integrated with its US plant. \"We use a lot of parts coming from the US for assembly here in Mexico in Puebla, and our colleagues in Chattanooga in Tennessee - they use a lot of parts coming from Mexico,\" explains Thomas Karig from Volkswagen Mexico.\n\nThis integration is possible because there are no tariffs to pay each time components are sent from one Nafta country to another. But when I ask whether Volkswagen has come under pressure from Mr Trump about keeping jobs in the US, the atmosphere cools and there is a curt \"no comment\".\n\nThe Nafta agreement has not benefited everyone in Mexico though. Some small farmers were unable to compete with US agricultural imports and big Mexican rivals.\n\nAccording to a study by the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research, from 1991 to 2007 some 4.9 million family farmers were displaced. Some found work with big exporting agricultural companies, but there was still a net loss of 1.9 million jobs.\n\nThree of Aurelio's children are illegal migrants in the US\n\nAn hour's drive from Puebla I meet Aurelio, whose family has farmed a tiny patch of land since 1925. Deep in the dry countryside he raises a few cows.\n\nJob opportunities are scarce and three of his five children have migrated illegally to the US where they have found work painting cars. But Donald Trump has said he wants to deport illegal immigrants. Aurelio takes out his mobile phone and calls one of his sons in the US. Is his son worried about this, I ask.\n\nHis son says that if there is a chance of being deported they will have to look elsewhere, but adds: \"Mexico is a tough choice because of lack of opportunities, violence, high taxes and the economic situation, so it wouldn't be easy.\"\n\nPresident Obama has deported at least 2.4 million illegal immigrants so this isn't a new policy. And according to the Pew Research Center, by 2014 more Mexican immigrants returned to Mexico than migrated to the US.\n\nLuis de la Calle says both the US and Mexico benefit from Nafta\n\nMr de la Calle acknowledges that the free trade agreement has split the country. He says there are two types of regions in Mexico.\n\n\"[There are] parts of the south of Mexico that are disconnected from international trade, that are lagging behind, where Nafta had little impact. Rates of growth are low, there is little investment, and you don't see large manufacturing operations.\"\n\nIn contrast to this, he says: \"There are 16 or 17 other states that grow very fast, you see a lot of dynamism.\" These he describes as \"Nafta states\" with exporting businesses.\n\nHowever, he dismisses Mr Trump's criticism of Mexico. \"He says [Nafta's] been great for Mexico, actually his whole argument is that Mexico is doing so well. It's flattering.\"\n\nHe also claims that the US is benefiting from its close manufacturing links with Mexico.\n\nHowever, when I ask who would come off worst if Nafta were repealed, the US or Mexico, he answers, \"Mexico because we are smaller, but the US would lose quite a bit as well.\"\n\nDonald Trump wasn't the first US presidential candidate to criticise Nafta. Hillary Clinton and even Barack Obama did so on their campaign trails.\n\nBut abandoning it completely? The US may find it has too much to lose and perhaps Mr Trump has realised that too.\n\nIn Business: Mexico and Mr Trump is on BBC Radio 4 at 20:30 GMT on Thursday, 5 January and at 21:30 GMT on Sunday, 8 January.",

            "content": "Intel's Project Alloy headset was announced last year - but the CES demo was brand new\n\nIntel has shown off a headset that can replace a room's pre-scanned furniture with more appropriate video game scenery in virtual reality.\n\nThe capabilities of the firm's Project Alloy headset, currently in development, were demoed at the CES tech show in Las Vegas.\n\nChief executive Brian Krzanich said Intel planned to license the technology to manufacturers by the end of 2017.\n\nBut one analyst said VR remained a difficult market to target.\n\nThe headset does not require a separate PC or a connection to a power source - both computer and battery are built in, noted Mr Krzanich as he introduced the latest prototype.\n\nTwo players in a mock living room demonstrated on stage how the headset could create a virtual replica of the room featuring scanned obstacles such as furniture.\n\nIn the demo, the bookcases and coffee table were then replaced, digitally, by similar-sized scenery more suited to the game - a futuristic spaceship.\n\nThe headset converted scanned objects into more appropriate bits of video game scenery\n\nProject Alloy was first unveiled in August last year, but this was its most advanced demo yet.\n\n\"It was certainly interesting,\" said tech analyst Brian Blau at Gartner, who also praised the freedom offered by an \"all-in-one\" headset without a cable.\n\nHowever, he said it would have been even more impressive had the living room been scanned by the headset itself.\n\n\"They did say [the room] was pre-scanned, so I was a little bit disappointed by that.\"\n\nThe device will not be manufactured by Intel, but instead it will offer the technology to other tech firms to build products around.\n\nIntel hopes this process will begin in the final quarter of 2017. But the project's success may rely on others being willing to make content for it.\n\n\"They can enable all kinds of stuff but if it is not for the rest of those pieces they'll just have the parts out there,\" said Mr Blau.\n\nA demo of Project Alloy last year showed how the wearer's hand could be represented within the virtual world\n\nThe firm also showed off a variety of other uses for a wide range of VR headsets - including high definition 360-degree video captured at a waterfall in Vietnam.\n\nMr Blau said the use of volumetric video - which lets viewers peer around objects as though they were really present in the captured scene - was impressive.\n\n\"It is something we won't really see en masse for a long time because of its heavy data requirements,\" Mr Blau added.\n\nOther chip makers besides Intel have been developing virtual reality headset technology.\n\nNvidia, for example, has been working on software and processors to power computing-intensive experiences.\n\nAMD is developing its Sulon Q headset, which - like Project Alloy - incorporates a computer and battery onboard, meaning no need for tethers or cables.\n\nChip maker AMD recently announced it's own Sulon Q VR and AR headset.\n\nThere is some optimism around the potential for growth within the virtual reality market at CES.\n\nUS unit sales of VR headsets are predicted to reach 2.5 million in 2017, according to a presentation at the trade show by the Consumer Technology Association.\n\nBut during Intel's event, Mr Krzanich acknowledged that many were still unsure if the technology would become truly popular.\n\n\"A lot of people are questioning is virtual reality going to take off, is it going to go anywhere?\" he acknowledged\n\nFollow all our CES coverage at bbc.co.uk/ces2017\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "section": "US & Canada",
            "content": "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. What is it like inside Guantanamo Bay?\n\nThese are uncertain times at Guantanamo Bay. Not only for the detainees but also those who guard them. After eight years in which President Obama has tried - and failed - to close the detention facility, what will President Trump mean for its future?\n\nThe first detainees arrived at Camp X-Ray 15 years ago in the early months of what was then called the \"War on Terror\". I first visited a few weeks later and watched the men in orange jumpsuits in steel cages in the hot Cuban sun.\n\nGuantanamo had been chosen partly because it was not US soil and so avoided coming under regular US law. The camp then had a thrown together feel - the Bush administration was improvising and no-one was sure how long it would last.\n\nThe orange jumpsuits worn by detainees became notorious\n\nThe next time I visited - two years later - Camp X-Ray had been replaced by the more permanent structure of Camp Delta. Guantanamo was here to stay.\n\nIts numbers grew - around 700 at its peak. But on his second day in office eight years ago President Obama promised to close the facility and the pace of transfers increased.\n\nOn my visit a few weeks ago, I found much of the Camp eerily empty, a lone iguana roaming around the barbed wire. But closing Guantanamo was a promise President Obama could not keep, partly because Congress blocked the transfer of any detainees to the US.\n\nFewer than 60 men are now left. There are 20 currently cleared for release and the Obama administration is trying to transfer some of these out before its term ends.\n\nBut on 3 January, President-elect Trump made his views clear in a tweet.\n\n\"There should be no further releases,\" he wrote. \"These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back on to the battlefield.\"\n\nMost of the remaining detainees are held now in Camp Six.\n\nInside a cell in Camp Six at Guantanamo Bay\n\nThe uncertainty hanging over the base was clear as we toured the detention block. We were able to watch and film detainees in the communal areas of their cell block through one-way glass, an unsettling procedure.\n\nThe detainees are not supposed to know we are there but clearly they realised as one put up a hand-painted sign showing a question mark with a padlock underneath.\n\nThey followed the election result like everyone else and Col Steve Gabavics, Commander of the Joint Detention Force, told me: \"They were all watching TV - their behaviour was pretty much the same as any other night.\n\n\"We didn't notice any significant negative response. No-one came to us angry, no-one protested. They were simply interested to see what was going to happen.\"\n\nColonel Steve Gabavics said they noticed no reaction to Donald Trump's election victory\n\nOne difference from my early visits is just how much more controlled - even mundane - the interaction between detainees and guards is now compared to the early days.\n\nThe attacks of 2001 were still raw and there was a tension and sense of underlying aggression on both sides. Now, the atmosphere is much more controlled.\n\nDetainees tap on a window to summon a guard when they have a message to pass and the guard proceeds through a door into a cage-like structure inside the cell-block where they can communicate with a detainee.\n\nDuring our visit in December, officials say that the detainees were \"compliant\".\n\nBut what does the arrival of President Trump mean?\n\n\"You know the detainees have questions - are the transfers going to stop when the new president takes office on 20 January? We don't know, they don't know. Their lawyers may speculate, but no-one knows,\" says Rear Adm Peter Clarke, commander of Joint Task Force Guantanamo.\n\nHe did say - before Donald Trump's latest tweet - that \"some of them may act up\" if they realise they are not going to be transferred.\n\nSomewhere else on the base, which sprawls across an otherwise isolated tip of Cuba, is Camp Seven. Its precise location is secret - leading to much speculation from visiting reporters.\n\nThis is where so-called high value detainees are being held - men like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 11 September attacks who is going through the long slow process of a military commission - a form of trial.\n\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed was captured in Pakistan in March 2003 and sent to the US detention centre in Cuba in 2006\n\nMight it be not only that transfers out are stopped, but that current detainees find they have some company?\n\n\"We are going to load it up with bad dudes,\" Mr Trump said in the campaign trail in February last year.\n\nCamp Five was built to hold detainees but now sits empty. What if President Trump decides he wants to not just stop people leaving but send in new detainees?\n\nThe maximum capacity of Camp Six is around 175 detainees. Camp Five could hold 80 - it has been part-converted to a new medical facility. That means potentially Guantanamo could accommodate more than 100 extra detainees pretty much immediately. More than that would require construction work.\n\nOfficials say it is a \"reasonable assumption\" that they would want to segregate new detainees who would be more likely to be members of so-called Islamic State rather than al-Qaeda.\n\n\"We are prepared to receive some if that was required in the short term,\" Col Gabavics told us.\n\nThe Obama administration's push to close Guantanamo also meant there was a reluctance to capture more detainees in counter-terrorism operations around the world, some former officials say.\n\nThey believe that a policy of \"take no prisoners\" created an incentive to kill rather than capture, with the administration increasing the pace and the geographical spread of drone strikes which - on occasion - might mean useful intelligence gleaned from interrogation or captured material might be lost.\n\nRear Adm Peter Clarke said he is confident he will not be asked to torture detainees\n\nMr Trump has also said that he would consider returning to the practice of waterboarding detainees. Could that take place at Guantanamo? Rear Adm Clarke said he was \"confident\" that there will be no torture at Guantanamo.\n\n\"Whatever orders we receive, by the time they come to me from US Southern Command, I am confident those orders will be legal orders that I will be ready to carry out,\" he said.\n\nIn the 15 years since Guantanamo was opened, the contours of America's war on terror have changed.\n\nNew enemies have emerged and the question of what to do with those America is fighting - where to put them, how to treat them and even whether to kill or capture them - will now be for a new president to decide.",

            "description": "In 1977 a woman thought she had finally tracked down the son she had abandoned as a baby. What followed was an extraordinary tale of deception and heartbreak.",
            "section": "Magazine",
            "content": "In 1977, Johanna van Haarlem finally tracked down the son, Erwin, she had abandoned as a baby 33 years earlier. She immediately travelled to London to meet him. What followed, writes Jeff Maysh, is an unbelievable story of deception and heartbreak.\n\nIt was a cold Saturday morning in April 1988 when a van full of detectives arrived outside the North London home of Erwin van Haarlem. The self-employed art dealer, 44, lived alone in sleepy Friern Barnet, a smattering of brick homes beside the grim North Circular ring road.\n\nThe Dutchman's apartment building on Silver Birch Close had become the centre of an investigation led by the British intelligence agency MI5. It suspected that Van Haarlem - whom neighbours described as an \"oddball\" - was not in the art business at all, but a sinister foreign agent.\n\nInside, Van Haarlem was hunched over a radio in his kitchen. He was still wearing his pyjamas, but his hair was parted neatly to one side. He was tuned in, as he was every morning, to a mysterious \"number station\". In his earpiece, a female voice recited numbers in Czech, followed by the blip-bleep of Morse code.\n\nAt 09:15 detectives from Special Branch, the anti-terror unit of London's Metropolitan Police, crashed into his apartment. Van Haarlem tried to lower his radio's antenna. It jammed. When he pulled open a drawer and grabbed a kitchen knife, an officer tackled him, and yelled: \"Enough! It is over! It is over!\"\n\nHidden among his easels and paintings, detectives discovered tiny codebooks concealed in a bar of soap, strange chemicals, and car magazines later found to contain messages written in invisible ink. Investigators suspected Van Haarlem was not really from the Netherlands, but was a spy for the UK's Cold War adversary, the Soviet Union.\n\nUnder a bright spotlight at a police station in Central London, Van Haarlem protested his innocence. Then, 10 days later, things turned really strange: a visitor arrived claiming to be the prisoner's mother. Johanna van Haarlem was a Dutch woman in her early sixties, who peered at detectives from behind huge glasses. Her son was no spy, she insisted, but an honest Dutchman - the child she had abandoned in 1944 and rediscovered 11 years earlier. The baffled detectives allowed her to visit their suspect.\n\n\"Tell me, I'm hearing all these strange stories,\" she said. \"You're not really a spy, are you?\"\n\n\"We have a saying that where you see the smoke, there will be a fire,\" Van Haarlem told her. \"But this time it is not true. Too much of the smoke and no fire. I did absolutely nothing that could harm England.\"\n\nJohanna sighed with relief. \"But why? Why all of this, then?\" she said.\n\n\"Don't ask me. Ask them.\"\n\nAnd then he noticed a tiny red spot on her forearm. The DNA blood test results from the Home Office laboratory indicated, with near certainty, that they were not related. Johanna van Haarlem broke down in tears as her world collapsed.\n\nJohanna van Haarlem was 52 on her first visit to London to meet Erwin\n\nOn 6 February 1989, at London's Old Bailey, prosecutor Roy Amlot told a jury that the defendant had stolen her son's identity.\n\n\"You may think that if he knew all along, it was a cruel thing to do to her,\" he said.\n\nThe trial captivated the press. The Daily Express described Van Haarlem as \"an old-fashioned... slick-suited spy who inhabited a world of dead letterboxes and secret codes\". Exotic beauties came forward to kiss-and-tell about their love affairs with the spy. But the most wounded victim stood in the witness box, the tragic Dutchwoman, Johanna van Haarlem.\n\nOn 4 March 1989, at 11:45, the judge sentenced Erwin van Haarlem to 10 years in prison for espionage. \"He is probably the first person to be tried at the Old Bailey under an alias,\" one senior Scotland Yard officer told a reporter. The \"spy with no name\", as the newspapermen called him, would take his secrets with him to his cell.\n\nAfter months of negotiation and false starts, I met Erwin van Haarlem on a spring day in Prague, in 2016. Although he had lived quietly as a free man for the past 23 years, spies famously do not talk. Introduced to me by the Czech crime journalist, Jaroslav Kmenta, Van Haarlem arrived at a restaurant near the city's Old Town Square, wearing a smart blue blazer. After carefully checking my identification he began, in accented English, to tell me his story.\n\nIt began on 23 August 1944, when he was born Vaclav Jelinek in Modrany, a small village near Prague. His father had owned a small bakery there, selling biscuits and ice creams, until the Communists took power. Young Jelinek enlisted in mandatory military service, and, as the Cold War intensified, he graduated to a position in the Czechoslovak Ministry of the Interior. He dreamed of military valour and excitement. But what he got was mind-numbing shifts and grunt work.\n\nOne day his superiors caught him studying German vocabulary instead of guarding a checkpoint in the snow. They marched him to an upstairs office where he expected disciplinary action. Instead he was introduced to two members of Statni bezpecnost - the Czechoslovak secret State police. The StB was a shadowy spy agency that reported directly to the Soviets.\n\nThe StB agents had studied his file and learned that Jelinek was defiant, a womaniser, highly intelligent, prone to violence, patriotic, and a risk-taker. In other words, perfect spy material. After careful training, they decided he was ready to begin an undercover mission abroad, spying on the West.\n\nThe StB searched through its files of missing persons and assigned Jelinek a false identity - that of a Dutch boy, abandoned at an orphanage in Holesovice, Prague, at the end of World War Two. The child had been born just one day before Jelinek.\n\n\"Your new name,\" they told him, \"is Erwin van Haarlem.\"\n\nHe applied for a Dutch passport, and arrived in London by train in June 1975. To the boy from Prague, it was an alien city swarming with traffic, fashion, and danger. He took a job at the 24th-floor Roof restaurant at the Hilton Hotel on Park Lane, Mayfair, hoping to spy on the Royals down the road at Buckingham Palace.\n\nAt night, he exchanged coded messages with his home country via radio. One of his first ideas was to try planting listening devices in the Queen's furniture, he recalls, though he and his bosses realised it was technically unrealistic.\n\nHis secret career was running smoothly until late 1977, when he received a disturbing message from Prague: \"YOUR MOTHER IS TRYING TO FIND YOU IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA WITH THE HELP OF THE RED CROSS. SHOULD THE RED CROSS FIND YOU, A MEETING IS TO BE AGREED WITH.\"\n\nHe read the message over and over again. In October of that year, Van Haarlem received a handwritten letter from Johanna van Haarlem. The Dutch embassy had given her his address, she wrote. She was thrilled to find him. As he had been ordered, the spy politely replied in November, enclosing some photographs. He began the letter: \"Dear mother\". When he sent a cordial invitation to visit him in London, she left immediately.\n\nJohanna woke up early on 1 January 1978, in a West London hotel. Her stomach was knotted with nerves. She stepped on to the street littered with the detritus of New Year's Eve. It was her plan to arrive early and check out her son's address. But on the opposite side of the street a familiar-looking young man walked past.\n\n\"Are you Mrs van Haarlem?\" the spy said, stopping in his tracks.\n\n\"Hello Mother, it's your son.\"\n\nThey embraced in the middle of the street. Johanna stepped back to look at him. Tears were rolling down her face.\n\n\"Your father did not have such dark hair,\" said Johanna, studying him. Then she commented that he was shorter than his father.\n\nInside his apartment a champagne cork popped as Johanna breathlessly told him her life story. The bottle had frozen in the refrigerator but Van Haarlem managed to pour a couple of glasses.\n\nShe had grown up in The Hague, in Holland, and was an 18-year-old virgin when she met his father on a train, in November 1943. Gregor Kulig was a Nazi. He was blue-eyed, 23, and Polish. Handsome. At a party four weeks later, she said, he raped her.\n\nAnd when her father discovered she was pregnant, he exploded. \"You are a sinner!\" he told her. He ordered her to take the child to a distant town and give him away.\n\nFull of sadness and desperation, in autumn 1944 Johanna travelled to Czechoslovakia by train. After a brief effort to survive there as a single mother, she walked into an orphanage in Holesovice, Prague. Sobbing, she kissed baby Erwin goodbye, and returned to Holland alone.\n\nHer father - a Jew who had joined the National Socialist Movement to protect his family - destroyed the adoption papers and banned her from ever speaking about her son.\n\nOver the years, dozens of letters arrived from the orphanage asking Johanna to take back her child. They went unanswered. But every year on his birthday, Johanna silently remembered her missing son, his name she could not even speak: Erwin van Haarlem.\n\nNow she had found him. As they finished their champagne, he took her hand in his.\n\n\"You have to believe it,\" he told her. \"I am your son.\"\n\nShortly after their emotional \"reunion\", Johanna invited Erwin to meet the Van Haarlem family in Holland. When the spy arrived at her bungalow in early 1978, one-by-one he shook hands with the whole family. They studied him like a specimen in a zoo. Johanna's niece approached Van Haarlem, and seemed to scan him from head to toe. Did she know?\n\n\"He has the nice Van Haarlem legs,\" she told the crowd, approvingly.\n\nBack in London, having a Dutch, Jewish mother only improved Van Haarlem's cover. His main task, the spy told me, was to gather information about Refuseniks, the Jews held in the Soviet Union despite their requests to emigrate, who had become political pawns in Cold War peace talks. He also gained prize information about underwater sonar chains, which alerted Nato to Soviet submarine movements.\n\nBritish defence journalist Kim Sengupta later described Van Haarlem in this era as \"a brilliantly successful deep penetration agent\", who, over the years, visited the Polaris submarine base at the British Admiralty's Underwater Research Unit, as well as \"a string of sensitive military installations\".\n\nFor these fantastic intelligence scores, Van Haarlem received a medal from the Soviet Union at a private party held in his honour in Prague.\n\n\"He moved a lot,\" Johanna later told a Dutch radio station. \"From that small apartment I visited the first time to bigger, fancier places\u2026 I had no idea why he moved so much. He was doing better and better, you could tell by his clothes, shoes and houses that he was going in the right direction.\"\n\nErwin showered Johanna with presents including a Wedgwood vase, a gold and sapphire ring, and a gold coin. But at heart he was tiring of this relationship with his \"fake\" mother. In his mind she was a Nazi, a fascist, and a collaborator with foreign soldiers. He recalls travelling to Holland to introduce a girlfriend to Johanna - keeping up appearances.\n\nInside the Dutch restaurant, folk music played and locals danced. Johanna got carried away, he said. A local man whirled her around the dance floor, and suddenly the spy saw her as a young girl, dancing with the Nazi soldiers.\n\nA blind rage swept over him like a fire. \"She is at that again,\" he thought. \"She never changes. She is 60!\" One of the men held Johanna close, and gave a friend a suggestive wink. It nearly tipped van Haarlem over the edge.\n\nSome time later, back in London, Van Haarlem's telephone shrieked. The blissful silence in his apartment was shattered. He sat up in bed and checked the time. It was 03:00.\n\n\"Dear son, I could not help it, I had to hear your voice.\" Johanna was slurring. Van Haarlem guessed she had been drinking. \"I will sell my house and come to London,\" she said. \"We will live together.\"\n\n\"I absolutely understand why you are so upset, Mum,\" he said. \"Of course it would be wonderful to live together, especially since our fate prevented us doing so in the past. Mum, you know what? Let's go to bed now and think about it overnight. I will call you tomorrow.\"\n\nHe slammed down the phone but could not drift back to sleep. He was growing increasingly concerned about her behaviour. He simply couldn't afford her to be a liability. His life depended on it. But there was little he could do - he was stuck with her.\n\nOn her next visit, mother and son were driving through Golders Green in North London when Van Haarlem forgot to give the right of way to another car. The other driver slammed on his brakes to avoid a crash.\n\n\"Sorry, friend!\" said Erwin pleasantly, with a wave of his hand.\n\nJohanna snapped. \"Why are you apologising?\" she shouted. \"You are so yielding, so soft! A typical Slav!\"\n\nVan Haarlem was shocked. \"He had the right of way,\" he said.\n\n\"Right of way! Right of way!\" she parroted.\n\nGripping the wheel, the spy fumed. \"You'll pay with interest for that,\" he thought. But he would never get the chance.\n\nOne afternoon in autumn 1986 Van Haarlem noticed two cars driving closely behind him, pulling manoeuvres he recognised from his spy training.\n\n\"They must be tailing someone,\" he thought. Then the penny dropped: \"They are tailing you! You stupid ass!\"\n\nHe had by now quit his job at the Hilton - after rising from a lowly waiter to assistant purchase manager. He had set up himself up as a freelance artist and art dealer, and paid cash for the unassuming flat in Friern Barnet.\n\nIt should have been the last place anyone would look for a foreign spy, but it soon became a hotbed of chicanery. There was the technician who came to \"fix\" his telephone, the new postmen, and the dedicated window cleaners who washed his windows not weekly, but seemingly daily.\n\nVan Haarlem was not the only one who noticed peculiar goings-on.\n\nMrs Saint, 61, who co-ordinated the local Neighbourhood Watch Scheme, said she telephoned the police in November 1987 to report strange noises and a \"Morse code\" interference which affected her television reception every night at 21:20.\n\nSoon afterwards, in April 1988, that mysterious van parked outside Van Haarlem's apartment.\n\nJohanna van Haarlem heard about the arrest on BBC radio. Then investigators arrived at her home and asked her to testify against the spy at his trial.\n\n\"When we finally made eye contact I felt hurt. I didn't see any sign of remorse, not a wink, no warmth, nothing,\" she said of the trial. A part of her was in denial, continuing to look in vain for a son's affection. \"He showed me coldness,\" she said, \"and looked at me like this was the end.\"\n\nVan Haarlem was sent to Parkhurst prison on the Isle of Wight. After five years, the end of the Cold War, and a hunger strike, he was released and deported to what had by then become the Czech Republic.\n\nI asked if he ever felt any compassion for Johanna.\n\n\"I had no pity whatsoever,\" he said.\n\n\"She was rather dominant and I had to put up with her. Sometimes I had enough of her,\" he added, describing many real mother-son relationships.\n\nDuring the five years he spent in a prison cell, he went on, one thing about his case remained a puzzle. It was a statement that Johanna made about how she found him. \"Without being asked,\" he told me, \"she said only on her own, from her own will, she started the whole action, trying to find me.\"\n\nFrom her own will. It was a funny thing to say, he thought.\n\nWas it a coincidence that Johanna's motherly instincts awakened just months after his application for a Dutch passport? Who else might have inspired her to track down her son, and why? We may never know, as Johanna van Haarlem died in 2004. However, the spy has his own theory.\n\n\"We thought she was under the guidance of MI5 or the Dutch security service,\" he said.\n\nCould Johanna also have been a spy? Though it seems unlikely, in this world of disguise and deception, anything is possible.\n\nAdapted from The Spy With No Name by @JeffMaysh (Amazon Kindle Singles), published today.\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.",

Amit Patel's guide dog, Kika, carries a camera which records the discrimination he can't see\n\nUnable to see the world around him, Amit Patel fitted his guide dog with a camera and set about recording evidence of the discrimination he faced but could not see.\n\n\"The city is a scary place. It's like someone put you in the middle of Trafalgar Square, turned you in a circle and said 'find your way home'.\"\n\nThat is Amit Patel's new reality after he lost his sight unexpectedly in 2012, 18 months after he got married.\n\nHe now relies on guide dog Kika to get him around the once familiar streets of London.\n\nBut the footage captured by his canine guide hasn't always shown a city willing to help him.\n\n\"The video came out of necessity,\" Patel says. \"Kika was getting hit by peoples' bags and she was getting a lot of abuse. A woman stopped me one day and had a go at me for holding everyone up and said I should apologise, which was a real shock.\"\n\nThe former doctor found a solution - attach a GoPro to Kika's harness and film every journey. Patel's wife, Seema, can then review the footage if it is felt there was something amiss about that day.\n\nAnd when alterations were made to a London train station the camera came into its own.\n\n\"I asked for help and no one came,\" Patel recounts. \"The video shows lots of staff standing around me and this one guy looking over many times.\n\n\"Eventually when the staff member actually came to me the first thing he said was 'sorry I didn't see you' and that really bugged me. He wouldn't say that to someone who wasn't visually impaired.\n\n\"It really makes me angry. It's the fact that someone is fobbing me off.\"\n\nAn image from Kika's footage of the Network Rail incident in London\n\nThe footage was sent to Network Rail giving Patel the \"valuable evidence\" needed to lodge a formal complaint about an incident he couldn't see.\n\n\"It made me feel vulnerable but having the footage was a godsend,\" he says.\n\n\"Having the camera, having the voice, having the actual scenario played out in real time it actually gives me something to go back to the company and say 'this is what happened to me and it needs to be sorted'.\"\n\nThe video had an impact and Network Rail investigated before giving further training to its staff.\n\nKika's camera captures an image of Amit on the London Underground\n\n\"While in this instance the event and associated disruption was not organised by or held at the station itself, we do recognise that the station can be a complicated place to navigate,\" a spokesman says.\n\n\"That is why we have hired many extra staff to look after passengers.\"\n\nFor newly blind Patel, standing alone for several minutes can feel like hours.\n\n\"One of the things I noticed with losing my sight is how lonely it is. If I'm travelling by public transport I will be the scared little boy sat in the corner. You can't listen to music because you're listening out for dangers or to station announcements.\"\n\nPatel says it is only since he lost his sight that he has become aware of the discrimination visually impaired people can face.\n\nPatel learned he had keratoconus - a condition which changes the shape of the cornea - in the final year of medical school.\n\nLenses to push the corneas back into shape stopped working and six cornea transplants were rejected by his body until he was told \"no more\".\n\nIt was a series of burst blood vessels which caused the unexpected loss of sight within 48 hours.\n\nPatel says: \"I woke up every morning thinking I'd get my sight back. For about six months I was quite shut off, depressed and I would go to the bathroom and have a cry.\n\n\"The one thing that stayed in my mind was that I would never see my loved ones. It was holding on to the last memories I had.\"\n\n\"There are taxi drivers who will see you and won't stop. You phone the company and they say they didn't see you, but you look at the footage and see them having looked at you and driving right past.\"\n\nOther incidents he says highlight a lack of thought - especially on London's Underground.\n\n\"People assume, because I have a guide dog, I can walk around them but they make us walk near the tracks or I can say to Kika 'find me a seat' and I'll put my hand down on one and someone will sit on it and refuse to get up.\"\n\nThe loss of his sight led Patel to change his life dramatically. The former University College Hospital doctor moved to New Eltham in south London so his wife didn't have to travel so far for work and wouldn't spend so much time away from him.\n\nThe view of New Eltham High Street from Kika's camera\n\nPatel says he had assumed, as a doctor, he would know where to get support, but he found that wasn't the case and he became frustrated at the simple mistakes he made - miscalculations led to stair falls and fingers were burnt from trying to find out how full his coffee cup was.\n\nBeyond the major life changes there were more subtle experiences too.\n\n\"Your balance goes awry. I felt like I walked on a cloud sometimes, and if I find a pair of shoes I'll buy three pairs because a change in grip makes a real difference.\n\n\"My hearing's increased and my sense of smell, and the way I touch things.\"\n\nThere have also been more unexpected side effects.\n\nThe camera has given Amit the confidence to go out alone with Kika and his baby son\n\n\"I have small pixels of light coming into my eyes and my brain interprets that as images. It'll put four pixels together and build a photo - so you may be sitting on the couch while thinking a car's coming towards you.\"\n\nPatel now supports people who have lost their sight unexpectedly and gives talks to community organisations using the GoPro footage to demonstrate what Kika sees.\n\nDespite all the challenges he has faced, including coming to terms with never seeing his baby son, Patel has accepted his new world.\n\n\"My life at the moment is so much more vivid, it's more colourful than it was when I had sight.\n\n\"It still fills me with dread leaving the house, because I have no control and am completely reliant on Kika, but we're out all of the time - any excuse.\"\n\nFor more follow on Twitter and Facebook and subscribe to the weekly podcast.\n\nJoin the BBC Stories conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "description": "A UK entrepreneur brings his earbuds that auto-translate languages to CES - but will he stand out from the crowd?",
            "section": "Technology",
            "content": "It sounds like a game-changing innovation: earbuds that auto-translate other languages. But what was supposed to be their big coming out week isn't going quite as planned.\n\nIf you're a tech company wanting to grab the world's attention this week, then Las Vegas could be the worst place to be.\n\nWhy? Well in the biggest CES yet with nearly 4,000 exhibitors you really have to shout very loud to be heard above the hubbub.\n\nIf you're a giant company like Sony or Samsung, you pour your marketing millions into spectacular press conferences and ridiculously lavish show floor exhibits where visitors have to wade through deep pile carpet while being deafened by loud music and shouty demos.\n\nSo, to arrive here as a one-man start-up with an innovative idea and try to get some attention requires both courage and optimism. Luckily Danny Manu has both in spades.\n\nWhen I met this young man from Manchester on the Las Vegas strip, he was desperately tired. His cheap flight from the UK had been delayed by eight hours on a Miami stopover - so he'd dashed from the airport to his AirBnB to drop his luggage, then came straight on to see me.\n\n\"I've not slept for 24 hours but I'm still moving and looking forward to it,\" he says.\n\nDanny's product is called Clik and he bills it as the world's first truly wireless earbuds with live translation. The idea is that you speak in one language and another person hears what you say in their own tongue, either via their own earbuds or via the MyManu smartphone app that Danny has already developed.\n\nSmart wireless earbuds and instant translation are ideas which giants like Apple and Google are addressing with vast investments - so it seems ridiculously ambitious for a one-man band to take them on.\n\nHe has already had a few setbacks. He'd hoped to have a working model ready for CES, but says delays in manufacturing in China mean the earbuds won't be ready for a few weeks.\n\nInstead, he demonstrates the system on a set of ear headphones, getting me to say Bonjour into an iPad which then comes out of his headphones as Hello.\n\nWe struggle with bad connectivity - often an issue when thousands are using the mobile networks at once - but Danny is hoping for a smoother demo in any of 37 languages when his stand is set up at the show.\n\nIt has been an extraordinary journey to get this far. He's been working on the idea for four years while holding down a full time job as an engineer at a major aerospace company. He tells me that when he went to China to sign a deal with Foxconn to manufacture his product he could only take three days leave, so spent just one day in Shenzhen - to the amazement of his hosts - then got back on the plane.\n\nHe has funded Clik from his own savings and a crowdfunding campaign and exhibiting at CES is costing him a tidy sum. So, is it worth it?\n\n\"I've had so many emails from companies that wanted to see the product,\" he says.\n\n\"That's the main reason I've come to CES.\"\n\nHe is also hoping to link up with distributors, manufacturers and other possible business partners.\n\nLet's be honest, the odds aren't great on Danny Manu beating the tech giants to launch a product that could transform the way we interact with people who speak a different language. In fact, he might be better to head to the roulette tables and pick a number to put his life savings on.\n\nBut this brave young British entrepreneur, with the courage to stake everything on an innovation he believes could change the world, is just what CES should be all about.\n\nFollow all our CES coverage at bbc.co.uk/ces2017\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "content": "Sir Tim Barrow is the UK's new ambassador to the European Union\n\nThe papers offer their interpretations of Sir Tim Barrow's appointment as the UK's new EU envoy after his predecessor resigned, questioning the government's Brexit strategy.\n\nThe Financial Times believes Theresa May has bowed to pressure by selecting a career diplomat, allaying concerns about the civil service becoming politicised.\n\nThe Times and the Guardian both argue that the prime minister wanted to calm the row about Brexit after the resignation of Sir Ivan Rogers highlighted strains between some mandarins and ministers.\n\nThe Guardian says the attacks on Sir Ivan's impartiality by former Conservative ministers had angered some senior civil servants, with some privately claiming they were considering stepping down.\n\nFor the Sun, Britain's new ambassador to the European Union is a \"wily behind-the-scenes fixer\".\n\nIt hopes Sir Tim will show ambition and optimism when it comes to leaving the EU.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph criticises what it sees as Sir Ivan's \"distinctly undiplomatic\" resignation message and calls on the civil service to demonstrate the loyalty and discretion it expects from ministers.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, theology students at the University of Glasgow are being warned they may see distressing images while studying the crucifixion of Jesus and are being given the chance to leave classes if they fear being upset.\n\nThe paper says this is part of a trend among a number of universities to let students know about parts of courses that might be disturbing.\n\nAdvocates say this helps protect the mental health of vulnerable students but critics believe people are left unable to face the realities of the world.\n\nOther examples, according to the article, include veterinary students being warned they will have to work with dead animals; while those studying forensic science are alerted that some lectures contain images of crime scenes.\n\nSeveral papers are concerned about the growing scale of household debt.\n\nThe Daily Mirror says it has reached crisis levels with consumer credit standing at \u00a3192bn, the most since the economic crash of 2008.\n\nIn particular, the Mirror highlights the plight of those aged 18 to 34 who are struggling in the face of low wages and rising rents.\n\nFor its lead, the Sun has been speaking to a refugee from Syria who says he was was waved through border control despite having a bogus passport.\n\nHe tells the paper that he bought the forged document for \u00a3300.\n\nThe Sun says this is evidence of a security shambles which leaves Britain wide open to an attack from the Islamic State group.\n\nThe Border Force declines to comment directly on the case but does tell the paper that technological changes have improved its ability to spot forged documents.\n\nThe Telegraph offers a wry assessment of the fallout after the Yorkshire seaside town of Scarborough barely noticed it had been struck by one of the biggest earthquakes to hit the UK in almost a decade.\n\nThe paper says that during the 3.8 magnitude tremor, which happened two nights ago, a woman reportedly lost control of her frying pan and afterwards people tweeted pictures of fallen wheelie-bins and capsized deckchairs, together with the slogan \"We will rebuild\".",

            "description": "The impact of the Ealing vicarage rape case can be felt by victims of sexual assaults 30 years later.",
            "section": "UK",
            "content": "In 1986 Jill Saward, who has died aged 51, was raped after a gang of burglars broke into the Ealing vicarage where she lived.\n\nHer father, Michael - the vicar of St Mary's, Ealing - and her boyfriend were beaten with cricket bats by the men, who demanded money and jewellery.\n\nIt was a sexual attack that shocked the nation, became headline news and was subsequently labelled the \"Ealing vicarage rape\".\n\nThe media coverage of the case and the sentencing of the men who attacked Ms Saward - who later became Jill Drake - led to a public outcry about how rape victims were treated.\n\nRingleader Robert Horscroft, then 34, who did not take part in the rape, was sentenced to 14 years in jail for his part in the burglary.\n\nMartin McCall, then 22, was given five years for rape and a further five for burglary, while Christopher Byrne, who was also 22, was given three years for his part in the sexual assault and five for the burglary.\n\nDuring sentencing, Old Bailey Judge Sir John Leonard said the trauma suffered by Ms Saward was \"not so very great\".\n\nMs Saward's case affected the way rape victims were treated and is still being felt 30 years later.\n\nThe public backlash against the media coverage and subsequent sentencing helped bring about changes to the way sexual assault cases were viewed.\n\nIn particular, there was uproar at how one of the defendants had been given a longer sentence for the burglary than the attack.\n\nSeveral MPs, including Neil Kinnock, criticised the prison terms handed down - saying they were too lenient.\n\nThe then-Labour leader said during a Commons debate in 1987: \"While it is necessary for judges to remain detached in the name of the law, sometimes they show an insensitivity to the suffering of victims which is difficult to comprehend.\"\n\nAnd Margaret Thatcher, who was prime minister at the time, expressed her \"deep concern\" over the crime of rape following concerns about the case.\n\nMs Saward's case also sparked fierce criticisms about press coverage of rape cases after Ms Saward's ordeal became front page news.\n\nWhile newspapers did not name Ms Saward as the victim, several of them published details which led her to be easily identifiable.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Jill Saward, who was gang raped in 1986, says her attackers got the same sentence as for aggravated burglary\n\nThe Sun newspaper printed the location of the attack and a photograph of Ms Saward with her eyes blacked out in the days following the rape.\n\nWhen investigated, the publication relied on the defence that media identification of a victim was only banned after a defendant was charged, which was the case at the time.\n\nSpeaking in 1987 Ms Saward, who was an identical twin, demanded a change in the law to prevent this from happening.\n\nAccording to the Guardian, she said: \"Unless this is done, others may find themselves identifiable by a process of deduction from third parties known to be involved as victims of a crime as I was.\n\n\"This was very distressing both to myself and my family, and the manner in which some newspapers conveyed this information was highly insensitive and offensive.\"\n\nThe law was changed a year later to allow for the right to appeal against lenient sentences and to close a loophole which allowed media identification of a rape victim before a defendant was charged.\n\nThe Press Council also published guidelines on how rape cases were reported to prevent victims' anonymity being breached through jigsaw identification.\n\nThe notorious case put the laws on rape under the spotlight and led to calls by women's groups and politicians to call for changes to the way the crimes were viewed.\n\nThese included making rape within marriage a criminal offence, making oral and anal intercourse classified as rape and tougher sentencing for rapists - all of which have been achieved.\n\nIn 1990, Ms Saward broke new ground when she became the first rape victim in the UK to waive her right to anonymity.\n\nShe co-wrote a book, Rape: My Story, which explored her ordeal and she went on to become a fierce campaigner for the rights of sexual assault victims.\n\nHer decision to speak publicly was driven by a desire to change attitudes towards victims and strengthen the support they receive.\n\nMs Saward launched a help group for those who had experienced sex crimes and regularly appeared in the media to highlight issues faced by victims.\n\nHer commitment to the cause also saw her become a sexual assault case worker and she subsequently provided training to police forces across the country.\n\nOver the years, further changes have been made to the way sexual assault cases are handled - taking into account the way victims were treated.\n\nThese include a ban on allowing an alleged rapist to cross-examine victims while representing themselves in court and restrictions on what evidence can be heard about a victim's sexual behaviour.\n\nNew guidelines were published on the sentencing of sex offenders in England and Wales in 2013 which gave a greater emphasis on the impact on the victim - something Ms Saward had long campaigned for.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, she said: \"So long we've felt left out of the system or surplus to requirement, so to actually see victims' needs and what's happened to victims being put at the forefront of this is really, really good.\"\n\nMs Saward never gave up on her fight for victims' rights, and in 2015 she spoke out against calls to give those accused of sex crimes anonymity.\n\nIn 1998, she came face-to-face with a member of the gang who devastated her life, but did not rape her, and told him: \"You don't need to say sorry.\"\n\nBut she also spoke about forgiveness and said in a BBC interview: \"I believe forgiveness gives you freedom. Freedom to move on without being held back by the past.\"",

            "description": "Some of the best business leaders profiled in 2016 for the BBC's The Boss slot give their advice on setting up and running companies over the next 12 months.",
            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Have you thought of your goals for the year ahead?\n\nWith 2017 now five days old, any business leader worth his or her salt has got their plans in place for the next 12 months.\n\nBe it a strategy to boost sales, a schedule to expand into new territories, or a way to deal with problems, this is the time of year to look ahead.\n\nHere, some of the best business leaders profiled in 2016 for the BBC's The Boss slot share their plans or thoughts on running a business in 2017.\n\nIt shouldn't be forgotten that your employees are your most important asset, and wellness at work - ensuring that your workforce is well looked after - has become a hot topic.\n\nInclude a regular slot in the working day or week for staff to work out together or alone, followed by a healthy communal lunch. This is a great way of bringing staff together socially, whilst improving their physical and mental health. This leads to a happier, more productive and collaborative workforce.\n\nThe best advice I have for someone running a business is listen to the winds of change.\n\nEvery industry is being transformed directly or indirectly by technology, and the rate of change will increase in the next few years.\n\nSo think not about what your business is doing now, but how it can be positioned in order to be a part of that technological transformation.\n\nThen, as always - work hard, learn from mistakes and keep evolving.\n\nStay curious and hunt for inspiration in unexpected places. We always try to look beyond the shop shelf, and I'd encourage all businesses to do the same.\n\nDefine your purpose. Major global events of 2016 mean that having clear direction, beyond your annual targets, is more important than ever before.\n\nIn the digital age of everything, keep it simple. Without bottomless pockets, you need to prioritise and have the discipline to focus on the real strengths of your team.\n\nBut also remember to keep things light and have fun. We make popcorn, we're not saving lives, but it's easy to lose sight of that sometimes.\n\nDon't forget to spend time and effort making sure people know what you have to offer. I see so many people who have great shows, great products and great ideas but decide to cut the marketing budget, or just think that it will work because it's clever.\n\nI always say you could invent a kettle that boiled in a second, but if people don't know about it then it doesn't matter. Get people excited.\n\nThink of interesting and amazing ways to get people involved and get your message out there. Create a community and harness the power of social media.\n\nBe brave and try new things. Become an expert in your field. Above all, have fun and people will soon be shouting it from the rooftops.\n\nThese are uncertain, challenging times, so businesses need to be brave and not be paralysed by fear of the unknown. At Unruly, for example, we haven't let Brexit brouhaha put the brakes on our growth - on the contrary, our foot is flat on the pedal, and we've accelerated international expansion into India.\n\nIt's also important that you nurture the wellbeing of the team. Make sure your team understands the value they bring to your organisation, and mentor them so they are prepared for the challenges ahead.\n\nOver the long term, the only strategy for an uncertain future is to keep and feed an open mind.\n\nKeep listening, keep learning, keep reading, keep evolving, keep experimenting, keep questioning, keep agile. Only then can you can keep on being at the cutting edge of trends that are reshaping the world we live in.\n\nI'm an optimist at heart and believe that if we build purposeful businesses with collaborative cultures, then rather than worrying about the future, we can help to shape it.\n\nI have four \"Ps\" as my guide. Firstly, passion - you must be totally passionate about what you do, because customers and employees will only be as passionate about your product or service as you are.\n\nSecondly - people. It is important that you employ great people. This will allow you to build a sustainable business with amazing customer loyalty and retention.\n\nThirdly - product. Make sure that you give a quality product that will allow you to build a business that customers and potential staff will want to be aligned to.\n\nFinally - profit. It is vital that you understand your numbers and know what is gross and net profit, and work hard to protect your margins.\n\nBusiness is like life - you get out of it what you put in. For me it is all about hard work, persevering and not giving up.\n\nSuccess in business is about finding the right balance between pushing yourself to your limits, and knowing when to take time out to re-energise, regroup, and to take a moment to plan your next big push.\n\nMany of us are great at the pushing bit, but forget about the importance of the other side, which can lead to burnout or perhaps a growing underlying resentment of the dream you're following.\n\nIn order to allow you the time to do this, it's essential that you build a strong team around you, who all share the same values.\n\nEmpower them, give them space to grow, and reward them in the way that pushes them forwards individually - what motivates your team will vary drastically between individuals.\n\nEvery business needs to expect even more work and new challenges in 2017.\n\nHere in Brazil there is an economic crisis that can't be ignored, but it is important for any company to spend more energy finding new ways to make things work out rather than cursing the current situation.\n\nWe're not letting geography determine who we hire - we want to find the perfect person for the role. They could be based in London, the Czech Republic, the US or Canada. All that matters is that they elevate the team and help us achieve our goals.\n\nI think this approach will slowly become the norm, and we'll see more big businesses adopt this way of doing things.\n\nTechnology is making the world a lot smaller, and communication has never been easier, which means you can always be in touch no matter where you are in the world.\n\nObviously there are processes you need to put in place to make sure everyone's doing the job that's being asked of them and to maintain a strong company culture, but once this has been ironed out the benefits are undeniable.\n\nBuild a team you can rely on. Over the last couple of years I've built up a strong senior management team who I am heavily reliant on for the day-to-day running of the business.\n\nThis has helped to give me space to breathe and focus on taking my business to new heights.\n\nAlso, take time off occasionally. I think it's extremely important to completely switch off from work every now and again.\n\nI spent Christmas in Sri Lanka, turned off my emails and focused on me. It means that I come back to work in January - one of the busiest months in our industry - refreshed, focused and ready to tackle the year ahead.\n\nBe clear about what you want to achieve in 2017. I have set myself half a dozen key things I want to realise this year.\n\nIf you get to the end of the year without achieving any or all of them, the things you identified at the start of the year were either not important, or you failed to deliver them.\n\nIf they weren't important after all, you called it wrong at the start of the year, which can be just as bad for your business as failing to achieve them.\n\nAlways be alive to what is going on with your competition, and with the market uncertainty we'll experience over the next couple of years this will be even more critical.\n\nToo many people are too insular within their business, and they don't see who's in front and, even more importantly, they don't see who's coming up from behind.",
