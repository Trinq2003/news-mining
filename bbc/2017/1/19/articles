            "content": "The \"impossible burger\" - as good as the real thing?\n\n\"My company's goal is to wipe out the animal farming industry and take them down,\" Patrick Brown tells me.\n\nThe grey-haired, former paediatrician turned professor at Stanford University School of Medicine, now turned start-up founder, may be softly spoken but he doesn't mince his words.\n\nA vegan, he's come to the World Economic Forum in Davos to evangelise about how ditching meat can save the planet.\n\nAt Davos, where helping the United Nations reach its goal of eradicating hunger by 2030 is one of its goals, he's got a receptive audience.\n\nA pop-up barbecue - set up by Brazilian charity Gastromotiva amid the snowy slopes - draws daily crowds. The company helps young people out of poverty by training them as chefs and creates its dishes out of food surplus that otherwise would have been thrown away.\n\nIt neatly illustrates the point that a staggering one third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally, around 1.3bn tonnes, which if used could help address the issue.\n\nBut Mr Brown's target is not the Davos elites but the masses.\n\nThe firm he set up almost seven years ago - Impossible Foods - is aiming to make the perfect meatless burger for \"the hardcore meat lover\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe 62-year-old came up with the idea during a sabbatical. Freed from admin and teaching responsibilities, instead of hitting the beach he pondered what was the most important problem in the world he could do something about.\n\nThe issue he hit upon was animal farming due to its environmental impact.\n\nWhile he personally has been a vegan for years, he said this was a personal choice and had nothing to do with his decision.\n\nRattling off statistics staccato style he says the sector uses a third of the world's water supply and land, with the greenhouse gas impact second only to the power industry.\n\nBut while startling, he admits such facts won't change people's minds or behaviour, or persuade them to eat \"cardboard food\".\n\nInstead, he decided to try to solve the problem scientifically.\n\n\"A different way of looking at it is that it's not a problem that people love meat and dairy products. The problem is that we produce them using animals, which is completely inefficient,\" he says.\n\nSo he set his mind to creating a burger - with the same nutritional value, taste and texture of ground beef - just without using an animal.\n\nThe vegan pattie is made from wheat, coconut oil, potatoes and, crucially, heme\n\nThe Californian firm's 70 scientists doing research and development treated the issue in the same manner as a biomedical one, says Mr Brown, figuring out the problem and working out what exactly it was in meat that made it so appealing.\n\n\"We needed to understand it in actionable terms so we could make deliberate choices to deliver those characteristics to consumers,\" he says.\n\nThe magic ingredient turned out to be a compound called heme. Their research identified this as the thing which made meat distinct, giving it a richer taste and its bloody, red colour.\n\nThe firm has now figured out a way to produce heme on a large scale cost effectively by using fermentation.\n\nSo far the resulting burger is available in just four high-end restaurants, although Mr Brown says this will soon expand to seven.\n\nThe decision to choose expensive restaurants seems at odds with his desire to persuade the masses to ditch meat. But Mr Brown argues that strategically it makes sense.\n\n\"We can only produce small volume so we have to get maximum brand building from every pound of product we make,\" he says.\n\nThe vegan burger is currently only sold in four high-end restaurants\n\nHe argues that by choosing well-known establishments - largely known for their meat offerings - it will help further the firm's name.\n\nBut you won't see \"vegan burger\" on the menu. \"It's divisive,\" says Mr Brown. Instead it's called the \"impossible burger\", with the small print explaining that the product is made from plants.\n\n\"People don't have to change their beliefs or buy into anything philosophically. The burden is on us to make a delicious and affordable burger,\" he says.\n\nBy the end of this year, production will ramp up, and he and his research and development team will double to 140 people.\n\nBut can it really compete with the mass market burger chains such as McDonald's and Burger King?\n\nMr Brown says he's already talking to places \"of that ilk\" but currently he remains focused on development rather than sales.\n\nPatrick Brown came up with the idea of the vegan burger during a sabbatical\n\nPushed on whether the burger can also compete on price, he is unequivocal.\n\n\"By the end of the year we will be selling the product at a price where thousands of restaurants can sell it to their customers at the same price range as other stuff, and we will make money on every pound of [fake] meat that we sell,\" he says.\n\nUltimately, he claims the cost of their burger will be \"substantially cheaper\" than a burger from a cow.\n\n\"The economics are so much in our favour. It takes a lot of resources to produce a pound of beef,\" he says.\n\nMr Brown isn't the only confident one. The firm has attracted funding from some big-name venture capital firms including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, and Horizons Ventures, which invests on behalf of Hong Kong business tycoon Li Ka-shing.\n\nHe says this investment is supporting research and development, which will continue as it moves on to replicating other meat products and fish in the same manner.\n\nAnd ultimately in the battle of cow versus meatless burger Mr Brown says he's got no doubts that he will win.\n\n\"I'm so completely confident I'm going to win this competition.\n\n\"A cow did not evolve to be eaten. It was just there and it's not getting any better at this. The product we have is now better than a month ago. We're optimising it for deliciousness.\"",

Now it is a completely new relationship and there is no animosity.\n\n\"There will be moments where it is going to be difficult, but I think that how the personalities are for the team it's going to be a good situation and one that is maybe a bit easier to handle than the past. But I could be wrong.\"\n\nBBC Sport revealed on Monday that Bottas had signed a one-year contract, with options to extend it into subsequent seasons.\n\nWolff said that was because a number of leading drivers' contracts were up for renewal at the end of the 2017 season - including multiple world champions Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso of Ferrari and McLaren - and Mercedes wanted to keep their options open.\n\n\"We wouldn't have chosen Valtteri if we thought that he was not good enough to continue with the team,\" said Wolff.\n\n\"But, as a matter of fact, the market is very dynamic at the moment. Next year options open - young drivers, Sebastian, Fernando, Valtteri, many of them. So it is about understanding that - and Valtteri does.\n\n\"Equally we have great faith and confidence in him that he can stay with us for a long time, but now we need to see how the season goes.\"",

            "content": "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Theresa May confirmed that the final deal would be put to the vote in Parliament\n\nFollowing Theresa May's widely anticipated speech on Brexit on Tuesday, you sent us your questions.\n\nThe impact on free trade was the most asked about subject. Below, BBC Economics Correspondent Andrew Walker looks at two of the most popular questions you asked:\n\nThe only thing on the list above that the Prime Minister has said she wants to opt out of is the free movement of people - or rather the free movement of people to work and settle in the UK.\n\nShe is very keen on the free movement of goods and services. She said in the speech that she wants: \"the freest possible trade in goods and services between Britain and the EU's member states.\"\n\nShe does not want to opt out of that.\n\nThe freest possible means what we have today. For example: no tariffs on goods travelling in either direction, mutual recognition of each other's technical standards, the freedom to offer services across borders and more.\n\nIn short, it means the provisions of the single market that apply to goods and services. It would be theoretically possible to go further still, especially in services. The European Commission says there are still barriers and it wants to tackle them.\n\nBut for now, the single market as it is represents the freest we can get.\n\nBut Mrs May seems to accept that we can't have that without also accepting freedom of movement for workers. And that is one of her red lines.\n\nSo once that has gone, the freest possible movement for goods and services will presumably mean something less than the single market, something less than we have today.\n\nHow much less will be a matter for negotiation. In fact, the answer to many questions about what will \"X\" be like when we leave will depend on the outcome of the negotiations. We can speculate but we can't know for sure.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Some of the headlines from Theresa May's vision for future UK-EU relations\n\nThe UK does have some cards which will encourage the EU to lean towards what the Prime Minister wants. Some European businesses have the UK as an important export market - German car makers for example.\n\nDuring the referendum campaign many Leave supporters were keen to point out that the rest of the EU exports more to the UK than the UK exports to them. That, they argued, means they need the UK more than we need them.\n\nThe counter-argument is that EU exports to the UK as a share of national income are a lot smaller than trade in the opposite direction. That suggests UK/EU trade matters more to us than to them.\n\nAnother reason that the remaining EU might want to be cooperative in trade negotiations is that many continental businesses would want to continue to be able to use the City of London as a financial centre. On the other hand some other cities, including Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin, might fancy a bigger slice of that pie.\n\nSo there are some economic reasons for the EU to share Mrs May's desire for free movement of goods and services.\n\nBut there is an important political issue that pulls them in the opposite direction. They don't want life in the UK to look too rosy at a time when there are rising Eurosceptic movements in many countries beyond the UK.",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "Every day, Miqdaad Versi searches newspapers looking for errors concerning Muslims and Islam\n\nWhen one newspaper reported last year that \"enclaves of Islam see UK as 75% Muslim\" last year, Miqdaad Versi's instinct was to challenge it. He believes errors in the reporting of Muslims have become all too common, and has made it his mission to fight for corrections.\n\nMiqdaad Versi sits in front of a rather geeky-looking spreadsheet at the offices of the Muslim Council of Britain in east London.\n\nHe is the organisation's assistant secretary general, but the task in front of him is a personal project.\n\nThe spreadsheet has on it every story published concerning Muslims and Islam that day in the British media - and he is going through them looking for inaccuracies.\n\nIf he finds one, he will put in a complaint or a request for a correction with the news organisation, the press regulator Ipso, or both.\n\nMr Versi has been doing this thoroughly since November, and before that on a more casual basis. He has so far complained more than 50 times, and the results are visible.\n\nHe was personally behind eight corrections in December and another four so far this month.\n\nMiqdaad Versi tweets diagrams showing corrections and apologies made following his complaints\n\nIn the past, corrections to stories were mostly printed when individuals were the victims of inaccurate reporting, but Mr Versi is looking at a whole topic.\n\n\"Nobody else was doing this,\" he tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. \"There have been so many articles about Muslims overall that have been entirely inaccurate, and they create this idea within many Muslim communities that the media is out to get them.\n\n\"The reason that's the case is because nobody is challenging these newspapers and saying, 'That's not true.'\"\n\nWatch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.\n\nMr Versi goes through some of the corrections from December. Five of them concerned a review into integration by Dame Louise Casey. The Sunday Times reported that \"Enclaves of Islam see UK as 75% Muslim\" in a preview of the review.\n\nThis was incorrect, with the review actually citing a survey of pupils in one largely Asian school who thought 50-90% of the population in Britain were Asian.\n\nThe paper corrected the article, and later apologised. As the same story was reported in other publications, it led to five corrections.\n\nMr Versi highlights another article, concerning the Muslim president of the National Union of Students (NUS). She was accused on Mail Online of refusing to condemn so-called Islamic State, when she had openly done so.\n\nAlso in December, he points out a report in the Sun on Sunday confused the identities of two Muslim individuals - one fighting against extremism and one accused of extremism.\n\nHe has met several newspaper editors and has been pleased with the quick corrections he has received in some cases.\n\nBut he is concerned that these revisions are not obvious enough to the reader.\n\n\"Sometimes the corrections lack a clear acknowledgement of the error they made and often do not include an apology. In addition, they are rarely given the prominence of the original article,\" he says.\n\nHe adds that while he is concerned with \"significant failings\" in the reporting of Muslims, the same issues \"might also be replicated for refugee, migrant or other groups\".\n\nOne particularly high-profile correction in December last year - that Mr Versi was not behind - involved a 2015 article in which Mail Online columnist Katie Hopkins wrongly suggested Zahid Mahmood and his brother were extremists with links to al-Qaeda, after they had not been allowed to board a plane to the US.\n\nThe Mail Online and Ms Hopkins apologised and paid \u00a3150,000 in damages.\n\nAt his home in Walthamstow, north-east London, Mr Mahmood says he has forgiven her. He now says it is not her original false accusations that he finds the most upsetting, but the public reaction.\n\n\"First they were all against us when Katie Hopkins published the article, and then when she made the apology a year later - then they all turn against her.\n\n\"There's no middle ground. It's not just about Katie Hopkins, it's the mindset of people - how they can very easily be led against somebody, or in favour of somebody.\"\n\nZahid Mahmood says he holds \"no grudge\" against Mail Online columnist Katie Hopkins\n\nMr Mahmood says he feels this kind of reaction is causing divisions in society, and - keen to do his bit for unity - tells the BBC he is formally inviting Katie Hopkins to his home for tea and coffee.\n\n\"We have no grudge against her, and we would like her to learn and know that we are as British as she is.\n\n\"In fact, my wife's grandfather and great-grandfather both fought in World War One and World War Two. They fought for the very freedom of this country.\"\n\nMr Versi says he wants to improve community relations too. He thinks inaccurate reporting has far-reaching consequences, especially because negative stories are often widely circulated by far-right groups and then the corrections are not.\n\nSome free speech campaigners, however, are concerned about this kind of work. Tom Slater, deputy editor of Spiked Online, says these complaints could create a fear of reporting certain issues.\n\n\"I, like anyone else, want a press that's going to be accurate... but what we're seeing here is quite concerted attempts to try and often ring-fence Islam from criticism.\"\n\nMr Slater says he found a recent correction to a story about a suspected \"honour killing\" particularly problematic.\n\nTom Slater worries such complaints are attempts to \"ring-fence Islam from criticism.\"\n\nIn May 2016, the Mail Online and the Sun used the phrase \"Islamic honour killing\" in their headline.\n\nMr Versi successfully complained to Ipso that Islam does not condone honour killings and that the phrase incorrectly suggested it was motivated by religion.\n\nThe word \"Islamic\" was removed from the papers' headlines, and at the bottom of the articles they wrote: \"We are happy to make clear that Islam as a religion does not support so-called 'honour killings.'\"\n\nMr Slater says he found that statement added by the papers \"absolutely staggering\".\n\n\"We all know a religion is just an assortment of ideas and principles. What these papers were effectively asked to do, and what they did do, was to print one accepted interpretation of a religion - and to me this was just like backdoor blasphemy law.\"\n\nMr Versi, however, insists his work is about ensuring the facts are right - not silencing critics.\n\nHe says there are many examples where Muslims can be rightly criticised and he is not complaining about those.\n\n\"All I'm asking for is responsible reporting.\"",

One patient who believed he could cure her cancer, British army officer Naima Houder-Mohammed, paid thousands of dollars for his alkaline treatment, which consisted mainly of intravenous infusions of baking soda.\n\nIn May 2009 Naima Houder-Mohammed was commissioned as a captain in the British army. The following year, tragedy struck. Naima was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nShe received treatment and was declared cancer-free. But in 2012, while training with the army skiing team, it was discovered the cancer had returned. Her condition was so serious she was offered end-of-life care.\n\n\"She refused to accept that this was the end,\" recalls her friend and former fellow officer, Afzal Amin.\n\n\"Naima was a fighter. She fought to get through selection for Sandhurst. She fought through Sandhurst and she fought her way through her life in everything she dealt with - army skiing or whatever it may have been. And this for her was another fight in that long list of victories.\"\n\nAs her medical options were limited, Naima did what many of us would do - she turned to the internet for a solution.\n\nShe came across Dr Robert O Young, an American alternative health writer selling a message of hope for cancer patients online.\n\nNaima began an email correspondence with him, which reveals how pseudo-science can be used to manipulate the vulnerable.\n\nYoung is the author of a series of books called the pH Miracle, which has sold more than four million copies around the world.\n\nThese books lay out his \"alkaline approach\" to food and health which has influenced many others, including the work of the British clean-eating guru Natasha Corrett, whose Honestly Healthy brand promotes her take on an alkaline diet.\n\nIn one email Young sent to Naima in July 2012, he told her \"there is a great need for a daily regime focused on\u2026 hyper-perfusing the blood with alkalinity\". He went on: \"I would suggest your healing program is going to take at least 8 - 12 weeks. It will not be easy but you will be in a controlled environment that will give you the care you need.\"\n\nNaima set about raising the money she would need - in one email Young mentioned a figure of $3,000 (\u00a32,440) per day.\n\nNaima's family used their savings, ran fund-raising events and managed to pull together tens of thousands of pounds with the help of a charity so that Naima could be treated by Young.\n\nBut the treatment did not have the outcome she was hoping for.\n\nOn one recent sun-kissed Californian morning, we drove up into the hills outside San Diego to visit Young. As we turned off Paradise Mountain Road, the parched golden grass eventually gave way to groves of avocado trees and we entered a millionaire's paradise known as the \"pH Miracle Ranch\".\n\nThe front door, preposterously set behind a moat, is reached by walking across some stone slabs.\n\nAs Young welcomed us into the ranch, our eyes were drawn to an empty spherical fish-tank built into the wall that separated the living area from the kitchen.\n\nNoting our interest, he began to share his alkaline view of the world, starting with what he calls the fish-bowl metaphor. \"If the fish is sick - what would you do? Treat the fish or change the water?\"\n\nHe went on: \"The human body in its perfect state of health is alkaline in its design.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe pH of our blood is 7.4, which is slightly alkaline, so Young is broadly correct - although different compartments of our bodies, such as our stomach, function at very different pHs.\n\nBut then Young's \"alkaline living\" vision becomes complete fantasy. Young believes that in order to maintain the pH of our blood, we have to eat \"alkaline\" foods.\n\nThe main problem with this view is that it doesn't appear to take into account the stomach, which functions at a pH of about 1.5 and is the most acidic compartment in the body. Thus, everything we consume, regardless of its starting pH, becomes acidic before passing into the intestines.\n\nAlso, the categorisation of foods into alkaline or acidic does not appear to follow any consistent rules, with certain citrus fruits (full of citric acid) considered to be alkaline, for instance.\n\nHowever, Young's view that alkalinity is good and acidity is bad goes beyond food. He told us: \"All sickness and disease can be prevented by managing the delicate pH balance of the fluids of the body.\"\n\nHe believes that when your blood becomes acidic, something weird happens, and your blood cells transform into bacteria - a phenomenon he calls pleomorphism - thereby resulting in a diseased state.\n\nThis, frankly wild, view goes against all current scientific understanding.\n\nWhen we put this to him, he simply disagreed, saying: \"Germs are nothing more than the biological transformation of animal, human or plant matter. They're born out of that.\"\n\nDr Giles Yeo with Robert O Young at the \"pH Miracle Ranch\"\n\nThe biggest problem is that because Young believes that disease emerges from acidity, then by extension disease can be reversed with alkalinity - echoing his fish-bowl metaphor that you don't treat the disease, but you change the environment.\n\nWhen Young said Naima would be cared for in a controlled environment, he meant the pH Miracle Ranch, which has a large area set aside as a \"clinic\" to treat cancer.\n\nYoung told us he uses the term \"cancerous\" as an adjective to describe a state of acidity.\n\nSince 2005 he has brought more than 80 terminally ill patients to stay at his ranch for months at a time. Treatment has included intravenous infusions of an alkaline solution of sodium bicarbonate - the same Arm and Hammer stuff you stick in your fridge to absorb smells.\n\nThis was the \"healing programme\" that was being sold to Naima.\n\nThere is no doubting the impact of Young's message. In an email, Naima wrote to him: \"I'll be pronounced text book perfect in a few months.\"\n\nAccording to her friend Afzal Amin: \"Naima was supremely confident that, with her willpower and this therapy, she would be healed. That was the overriding emotion in her that yes, I am going to better.\"\n\nWe put it to Young that someone like Naima, in a terminally ill state, who was desperate for a cure, would buy anything, try anything to help get better.\n\nHe responded: \"But I wasn't selling her anything\u2026 I didn't force her to come here, it was her decision.\"\n\nYet, in one email Young insisted on Naima paying for her treatment, before she stepped on to the plane.\n\nAll in all, Naima and her family paid Young more than $77,000 (\u00a362,700) for the treatment.\n\nYoung told us: \"The doctors need to be paid and the people that are doing the massages need to be paid and the colonics, but I gave her the best price to make sure that those people were paid.\"\n\nThere is no evidence whatsoever that infusing an alkaline solution into your bloodstream will do anything against cancer. When we raised this with Young, he said: \"These things need to be studied.\"\n\nAfter about three months at Young's facility, her condition worsened and she was taken to hospital. Naima was brought back to the UK and died with her family. She was 27.\n\nAfzal Amin told us: \"They feel utterly betrayed. It's just horrific that somebody could exploit people for money. This is I think for them the most disturbing element, that for something as cheap as money he was just able to destroy people's lives.\"\n\nYoung's activities at the pH Miracle Ranch have not gone unnoticed by the authorities.\n\nIn 2011 the Medical Board of California began an undercover investigation after concerns were raised by a woman treated there.\n\nInvestigators were able to establish the prognosis of 15 cancer patients treated at the ranch - none of them outlived it.\n\nOne patient, Genia Vanderhaeghen, died from congestive heart failure - fluid around the heart - while being treated. Young told us he was \"out of town\" at the time.\n\nAccording to an invoice we obtained, she had been given 33 intravenous sodium bicarbonate drips, each charged at $550 (\u00a3448), over 31 days. Some were administered by Young himself.\n\nLast year Young was convicted of two charges of practising medicine without a license, and now faces up to three years in prison.\n\nIn court it was revealed that he is not a medical doctor and bought his PhD from a diploma mill.\n\nWe asked him if he felt remorse for what he had done. He said: \"I don't have remorse because of the thousands if not millions of people that have been helped through the [alkaline diet] programme.\"\n\nWe asked Natasha Corrett to comment on the influence of Robert Young on Honestly Healthy. She told us: \"We believe that our bodies should be fuelled with healthy and nutritious ingredients but we also believe that life is about having things in moderation.\"\n\nUpdate, October 2018: Robert O Young was sentenced to three years and eight months in prison in 2017 for practicing medicine without a license.\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.",

            "section": "US & Canada",
            "content": "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. What was Melania Trump like in Slovenia?\n\nThe President Burger is presented with a flourish - on a wooden board, surrounded by circular \"dollar fries\" and topped with a yellow crust of cheese \"hair\" which looks as if it might fly away at any moment.\n\nAs tributes to the US President-elect go, it may not be the most respectful. But it is offered with the affection and gentle humour which it soon becomes apparent is a hallmark of Sevnica, a Slovenian town which just happens to be the place where Donald Trump's first-lady-to-be, Melania, spent most of her childhood.\n\n\"We formed the burger so it would resemble Trump a little bit,\" chuckles Bruno Vidmar, the chef-proprietor of Rondo, a restaurant in the newer part of Sevnica.\n\n\"It has hot peppers, because Trump's statements are hot - and it comes with dollar fries because he's a successful entrepreneur.\"\n\nThe owner of the Rondo restaurant designed this burger to resemble Donald Trump\n\nThe presidential tie-in seems to be serving Rondo well: on a weekday morning, the place is buzzing with an early lunch crowd from the nearby furniture and textile factories. Meanwhile a table full of smartly-dressed young women order another of Bruno's culinary creations dreamt up with Sevnica's most famous daughter in mind.\n\n\"The 'Melanija' dessert is made out of sponge, then there's a layer of mascarpone and strawberries. It's light enough for a model - and we have it on good authority that Melania loves strawberries.\"\n\nSevnica is a small place - so Bruno probably did not have to search long to find an authority on what Melania likes for pudding. Or, at least, what she did like when she was growing up as Melanija Knavs in this town of fewer than 5,000 people.\n\nBar the addition of a branch of Lidl on the outskirts, little seems to have changed since she left for Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana, as a teenager. The old castle - parts of which date back to the 12th Century - still overlooks Sevnica from its hilltop perch.\n\nThe town itself is a tidy place with new and old sections, sitting alongside the River Sava and surrounded by forested hills. The Slovenian Tourist Board suggests that Sevnica is \"an excellent destination for those who enjoy picnics and outings, hiking, cycling or fishing\".\n\nIf the roads had been less icy, it would certainly have been an enjoyable ride through the trees to Gosti\u0161\u010de Ob Ribniku, a restaurant and guesthouse next to a small lake. Inside the traditional wooden chalet, you can chat to one of the people who can shed some light on the future first lady's early years.\n\nSevnica is \"an excellent destination for those who enjoy picnics and outings, hiking, cycling or fishing\" according to the Slovenian Tourist Board\n\n\"We were next door neighbours - and we used to go the same way to school,\" says Mateja Zalezina, who runs Gosti\u0161\u010de Ob Ribniku with her husband, Dejan.\n\n\"In the afternoon when we came back we used to hang out in front of the apartment block. Even then she was quite busy, because her mother was a fashion designer and Melania was one of the models for the Jutranjka company that did fashion for kids.\"\n\nMateja laughs at the idea that she could have spotted that her neighbour would go a long way from Sevnica - never mind all the way to the White House. But she says that Melania could not help but stand out.\n\n\"She was really good at school. She and her sister Ines were studying really hard. After school, we played a game called 'gumi-twist', an elastic band game, and she was really good at that. She had the figure of a model - really long legs - and she always won!\"\n\nThe restaurant is offering a three-course \"Melanija Menu\" in honour of Mateja's former playmate. But, like Rondo's eponymous offering, this does not feel like a culinary cash-in, just a low-key tribute, delivered with affection.\n\n\"I'm really happy for her - she's achieved the maximum,\" says Dejan. \"I hope everyone in Sevnica will watch the inauguration. We will be here at the restaurant with friends and will raise a glass to them both.\"\n\nMelania's former neighbour says America's next first lady studied \"really hard\" at school\n\nBack in the old town, beneath the castle, Sevnica's mayor Srecko Ocvirk is not planning any special events to mark the start of the Trump era. But he hopes the publicity will bring the town's charms to the attention of tourists.\n\n\"The first visitors who came were journalists like you,\" he admits. \"But we're now seeing there are rising numbers of tourists. We're also expecting more organised tour groups after the inauguration. Sevnica and the region will become better known because of this.\"\n\nAt the town's primary school, one of the staff has certainly achieved a degree of local celebrity. Art teacher Nena Bedek was best friends with Melania until the future Mrs Trump left to finish her schooling in Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana.\n\nNow Nena fields questions from her students about her friendship with Sevnica's most famous former resident - and marvels at the different paths their lives have taken.\n\n\"It's a 'wow' effect for us and for me,\" she says.\n\n\"She was a reliable girl and a very good friend. But she never wished to stand out - even though she was beautiful and hard-working. She loved to read and draw. She was brought up in a very artistic manner - she knew what was beautiful - due to her mother's job as a fashion designer. I have very fond memories and keep her very close in my heart.\"\n\nAs for the town's various tributes - which include wine, slippers and honey as well as the culinary offerings - Nena believes they are in keeping with the Sevnica spirit.\n\n\"They are very sympathetic and sweet - none of them are bad things - and it's also funny. I think it's still within limits - all in all it's sweet and nice.\"\n\nRather like Sevnica itself, perhaps.\n\nYou can hear Guy De Launey's report from BBC Radio 4's World Tonight via BBC iPlayer.",

I first met him when we played a Davis Cup tie probably nine, 10 years ago. You spend a week together in the build-up and since then I've seen him a lot at various events.\n\nHe used to have a reputation of maybe not working that hard but every time I have been on the court with him, he has been fantastic.\n\nHe's a natural competitor. Once you get him on the match court, he always tries his best and gives his best effort and I really respect that.\n\nAway from the court, he's a pretty relaxed guy. He doesn't take himself too seriously and he likes to have a good time, but when he's playing, he's focused. He's a very talented player.\n\nI haven't spoken to him loads about his tennis. He has a team around him that is doing such a fantastic job.\n\nIf he keeps doing what he's doing, who knows where he could end up? It's exciting to see how good he is going to be. We still don't know what his limit is.\n\n'We want to inspire kids to pick up a racquet'\n\nIt's a really promising time to be part of British tennis. A number of players are close to the top of their game and that's really good.\n\nI definitely think that having a number of different players, with different personalities and backgrounds and playing styles, is really positive. I hope it keeps going that way.\n\nA lot of kids might watch tennis and hate watching me. But some might love watching Johanna Konta, or Dan, or Kyle Edmund or Heather Watson.\n\nThe more choice there is, the more role models people have to look up to and that is a really positive thing.\n\n'I was worried about my ankle'\n\nThere was a moment of panic when I went over on my ankle during my match against Andrey Rublev. You don't know how bad it is until you get up and you're also a bit shocked about going over.\n\nOnce I got up and started moving around, it was still a bit concerning because it was sore. I'm walking around on it fine now - it's sore, but it's OK.\n\nFor now, it's all about icing it and keeping it elevated. I had an ice bath after the game and I'll be keeping it cool for the next few days. It's all good.\n\nFacing Rublev did give me a few flashbacks to when I was first starting out.\n\nI played Rafael Nadal when I was 19 at the 2007 Australian Open. Going out for the first time against one of the top players does influence the way you play.\n\nI expected Rublev to come out going for his shots, because he had nothing to lose. He got off to a pretty quick start but once I settled down, I played some good stuff. He's a good player though and definitely one to watch in the future.",

The Sun says British travellers have complained of shambolic organisation.\n\nThe Times says the scenes of crisis are depressingly predictable.\n\nPresident Yahya Jammeh can avert bloodshed by doing the right thing, it says, or condemn his country to isolation and be remembered as a pariah.\n\nThe i newspaper suggests that an \"evocative slice of authentic Americana\", painted by none other than Bob Dylan, might actually be a picture of the pier at Blackpool.\n\nSharp-eyed observers who saw the watercolour at a London gallery found it was identical to a picture posted on the internet by a British photographer.\n\nEven a bird on a lamp-post was identical. The photographer tells the Telegraph he is not angry but \"astonished\" that his work has been appropriated by a Nobel laureate - and labelled as being Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nThe paper suggests the singer was perhaps unconsciously influenced by playing three concerts at Blackpool's Winter Gardens in 2013.",

            "section": "US & Canada",
            "content": "On 20 January, inauguration day in the United States, a nameless, unknown military aide was seen accompanying President Barack Obama to the handover ceremony at the US Capitol in Washington.\n\nThat military aide was carrying a satchel over his or her shoulder containing a briefcase known as \"the nuclear football\". Inside was a piece of digital hardware measuring 3in (7.3cm) by 5in, known as \"the biscuit\".\n\nThis contained the launch codes for a strategic nuclear strike. The briefing for the incoming president on how to activate them had already taken place out of public sight, but the moment President-elect Donald Trump took the oath of office that aide, and the satchel, moved quietly over to his side.\n\nFrom then on, Donald Trump has had sole authority to order an action that could result in the deaths of millions of people in under an hour. The question on a lot of people's minds is, given his thin skin and impulsive temperament, what are the safeguards, if any, to prevent an impetuous decision by one man with catastrophic consequences?\n\nFirst off, it should be said that Donald Trump has previously rowed back on some of his earlier, provocative comments on the use of nuclear weapons. He stated he would be \"the last person to use them\", although he did not rule it out.\n\nOther senior figures are also involved in the chain of command, such as the US Secretary of Defence, retired US Marine Gen James Mattis, But Mark Fitzpatrick, a nuclear non-proliferation expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Washington, says that ultimately, the sole authority to launch a strike rests with the president.\n\n\"There are no checks and balances on the president's authority to launch a nuclear strike,\" he says. \"But between the time he authorises one and the time it's carried out there are other people involved.\"\n\nThe idea of a rogue president taking such a monumental decision on his own is unrealistic. He gives the order and the secretary of defence is constitutionally obliged to carry it out.\n\nThe secretary of defence could, in theory, refuse to obey the order if he had reason to doubt the president's sanity, but this would constitute mutiny and the president can then fire him and assign the task to the deputy secretary of defence.\n\nDonald Trump says the US should \"greatly strengthen and expand\" its nuclear capabilities\n\nUnder the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution a vice-president could, in theory, declare the president mentally incapable of taking a proper decision, but he would need to be backed by a majority of the cabinet.\n\nSo how would it work in practice?\n\nInside that briefcase, the \"nuclear football\" that never leaves the president's side, is a \"black book\" of strike options for him to choose from once he has authenticated his identity as commander-in-chief, using a plastic card.\n\nWashington folklore has it that a previous president temporarily mislaid his identification card when he left it inside a jacket that was sent to the dry cleaners.\n\nOnce the president has selected his strike options from a long-prepared \"menu\", the order is passed via the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the Pentagon's war room and then, using sealed authentication codes, on to US Strategic Command HQ in Offutt Airbase in Nebraska.\n\nThe order to fire is transmitted to the actual launch crews using encrypted codes that have to match the codes locked inside their safes.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe US and Russia both possess enough nuclear missiles to destroy each other's cities several times over - there are reported to be 100 US nuclear warheads aimed at Moscow alone. The two countries' arsenals account for more than 90% of the world's total number of nuclear warheads.\n\nAs of September 2016 Russia had the most, with an estimated 1796 strategic nuclear warheads, deployed on a mixed platform of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and strategic bombers.\n\nUnder a programme ordered by President Vladimir Putin, Moscow has recently invested billions of roubles in upgrading its strategic nuclear missile force, keeping an arsenal of constantly mobile ballistic missiles travelling through tunnels deep beneath the forests of Siberia.\n\nAmerica had, in September 2016, 1,367 strategic nuclear warheads, similarly deployed in land-based underground missile silos, which by their static nature are vulnerable to a first strike, at sea onboard submarines, where they are harder to detect, and at airbases, where they can be loaded on to bombers.\n\nThe UK has about 120 strategic warheads, of which only a third are deployed at sea. The Royal Navy always keeps a portion of the nation's Trident nuclear force somewhere in the world's oceans, maintaining what is known as the continuous at sea deterrent.\n\nThe Topol is one of Russia's mobile ICBMs\n\nICBMs travel at a speed of over 17,000mph (Mach 23), flying high above the Earth's atmosphere before descending towards their pre-programmed targets at four miles a second.\n\nThe flight-time for land-based missiles flying between Russia and the US is between 25 and 30 minutes. For submarine-based missiles, where the boats may be able to approach a coast covertly, the flight time could be considerably shorter, even as little as 12 minutes.\n\nThis does not leave a president much time to decide whether it is a false alarm or imminent Armageddon. Once ICBMs have been launched they cannot be recalled, but if they remain in their silos they will probably be destroyed by the inbound attack.\n\nA former senior White House official told me recently that much would depend on the circumstances in which a nuclear strike was being considered.\n\nIf this was a long-term, measured policy decision to say, carry out a pre-emptive strike on country X, then a lot of people would be involved. The vice-president, National Security Adviser, and much of the cabinet would all be likely to be included in the decision-making process.\n\nBut if there was an imminent strategic threat to the United States, i.e. if an inbound launch of ICBMs from a hostile state had been detected and were minutes from reaching the US then, he said, \"the president has extraordinary latitude to take the sole decision to launch.\"",

Even if you don't - it's pretty likely your children or your grandchildren will.\n\nWhile Brexit, China and Trump may be dominating the news out of this year's World Economic Forum in Davos, living longer is a hot topic in the cold and snowy mountain village, and one which many attendees are already grappling with.\n\nCurrent trends suggest most babies born since 2000 in developed countries such as the UK, US, Canada, France and Germany, will live past their 100th birthday.\n\nPut another way, for every 10 years since the 19th Century, life expectancy has increased by two and a half years, according to Jim Vaupel from Max Planck Institute of Demography, who has tracked global changes over the past 150 years.\n\nThat's the equivalent of another six to eight hours every day.\n\nIt may sound great - after all who doesn't want to live for as long as possible - but the reality is we may also be working for as long as possible to be able to pay for it.\n\n\"If we live 30 years longer, then in order to retire at 60 we would have to save five times as much during our working lives. It's the end of retirement as we know it,\" says Lynda Gratton, who hosted a session on the topic in Davos.\n\nShe is a psychologist, and professor of management practice at the London Business School, and has written a book on the topic.\n\nThe effects of people living longer is one of the hot topics in Davos\n\nRather than the three traditional stages of life: education, work and retirement, Ms Gratton expects people to have to constantly retrain as they shift careers and focus.\n\nCounter-intuitively, she suggests that one positive of having a longer career could actually mean a better work-life balance.\n\nIf you're working for longer, then taking a couple of years out to look after children, or ageing parents for example, won't be such a big deal when your career lasts for 60-plus years, she suggests.\n\nJo Ann Jenkins, chief executive at non-profit group AARP - the influential lobby group for older Americans - says working longer is already a reality for many in the US.\n\nIn 2012, US employees aged over 50 made up almost a third of the workforce. By 2022 they're expected to make up 36%.\n\nThe shift has already forced the group to change its name. The body used to be called the American Association of Retired Persons, but had to change it to just AARP because its members complained they weren't retired, but still working.\n\n\"People used to think middle age started around 35. Now, most people think it's late 40s or early 50s. Same thing with one's working years. Someone who was 55 or 60 often used to be seen as over the hill. That's not the case today,\" says Ms Jenkins.\n\nShe believes one of the big adjustments will be how to manage the increasing breadth of age groups in the workplace.\n\n\"Years ago, one of the big questions was: can a man report to a woman manager? We've answered that question. Today, a big question is: can an older employee report to a younger manager? I think many organisations are still grappling with that.\"\n\nOf course, increased life expectancy isn't always matched by better health.\n\nChristophe Weber, the chief executive of Japanese pharmaceutical giant Takeda, says the key issue is how long people are remaining well.\n\nIn Japan, around a quarter of the population is now over 60, and Mr Weber notes that this increasing longevity also means certain diseases such as dementia, for example, are on the rise.\n\nHe says research and finding new medicines to address the issue will be crucial.\n\n\"[People living longer] is a very nice evolution but the challenge is how you finance it,\" he says, adding that the healthier people are, the less costly it is.\n\nAs far as work goes, he says people need \"a soft landing carrier to retirement\", suggesting while older people may remain at work, they're likely to work part-time, or in less hands-on mentoring roles.\n\nBut if even the idea of working part-time when you're in your 70s seems depressing, Ms Gratton has some encouragement.\n\nShe says the fact that you're likely to have to change jobs and retrain several times to remain employable over 60 years offers a natural break to take time out.\n\n\"Take a gap year. Why should it only be the young who take gap years? You could take a gap year at 50, and travel around the world,\" she says.",
