            "section": "US & Canada",
            "content": "It is as if the campaign is still going on.\n\nTwo weeks away from his inauguration, Donald Trump seems to prefer the role of \"candidate\" - flaying his opponents and aiming arrows at the federal government from the enemy camp.\n\nIt is almost as if he does not want to accept fully that he is the new chief executive who will be dealing with official Washington from the moment he drives back from the Capitol as the president on 20 January.\n\nAnd his weapon of choice, forged for him like a legendary warrior's sword in the furnace of the new technology, is Twitter.\n\nNo president-elect has battled like this.\n\nMost of them go to ground, secluded with the staff who will take over the West Wing, and make their plans. Dream their dreams, you might say.\n\nThey have followed the golden rule: do not give too much away, because it will make life more difficult when the inauguration is over and the business of power begins.\n\nThe Trump Twitter account is not just a break with that pattern, but a challenge to the very idea.\n\nHis New Year tweet (one of them, I should say) wished love to everyone \"including my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do\".\n\nMr Trump wished love to everyone via Twitter at the turn of the year\n\nThe implication, of course, is that he does know what he is going to do. The trouble with his Twitter account is that it makes you wonder.\n\nMore than 34,000 tweets to nearly 19 million followers (many \"enemies\" among them, no doubt) and a narrative that has become a kind of stream of consciousness. They read like the unfiltered, disconnected thoughts of someone for whom patience is an ugly word.\n\nYou always have to say something, even if you say the opposite the next day. On Twitter, who cares?\n\nYet, the messages are powerful. One contemptuous tweet about the new Republican majority in the House of Representatives winding down the Office of Congressional Ethics led them to beat a humiliating retreat and cancel the plan.\n\nMr Trump's choice as White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said the other day: \"Whatever he tweets, he is going to drive the news.\"\n\nAnd, bizarre though it may seem, the South Korean government is poring over them. The JoongAng Daily reported that a Twitter-watching position had been set up in the foreign ministry in Seoul \"because we don't yet have an insight into his foreign policies\".\n\nWhat insight will they get from tweets which have criticised the Central Intelligence Agency, praised Julian Assange - the Whistleblower of WikiLeaks and a bete noire to most Republicans - and praised President Putin, who gets more friendly treatment than all Democrats and some Republicans at home?\n\nAnd remarkably the tweets take aim at the entire intelligence community in Washington. What precisely are the South Koreans meant to make of that?\n\nNot too much, you may think, because who can tell how this mercurial candidate is going to be moulded into a president? We still do not know and what his Twitter account tells us - colourfully, astonishingly, sometimes hilariously - is that he is refusing to let us know.\n\nFar from revealing what a Trump presidency is going to be like - as he says his tweets do - they have the effect of enveloping him in a thick fog.\n\nYes we know he will \"make America great again\", cut immigration, build his wall, cut taxes, be Israel's greatest ally and so on. But how he is going to build a White House team on foreign affairs and security, conduct relations with Capitol Hill, deal with allies in Nato and the rolling chaos in the Middle East, we have very little idea.\n\nAnd when the first crisis arrives - as it will before long - will he be able to find the calm that he needs?\n\nWhere it all began: Trump's Twitter page in April 2009\n\nNo president-elect in modern times has said so much and revealed so little.\n\nWe know how Mr Trump feels about almost everything, but about priorities, his approach to the compromises of power, the way he will deal with the bureaucracy - in practice we know very little.\n\nA week or two before election day in November, one of his close associates told me that, if he won, Mr Trump had agreed that in office he would relinquish control of that Twitter account, because it would be inappropriate in the White House.\n\nThe satirists' loss, certainly. But, if it happens, a step into reality, at last.\n\nSome day he has to stop being the candidate and playing that game, even though he enjoys it so much.\n\nSo the first great test for the Trump White House team is surely getting his finger off that keyboard.",

            "content": "The futuristic looking Core is controlled via a smartphone app\n\nSecurity firms have launched routers at CES that can stop smart household gadgets being hijacked by hackers.\n\nSymantec, BitDefender and Intel unveiled devices that scrutinise data as it flows across home networks.\n\nThe companies say routers with built-in defences will be essential as homes are filled with net-connected gadgets.\n\nThe routers also come with parental control features that help manage how much time children spend online and what they see.\n\n\"You will have to buy a security solution for your internet-of-things,\" said Alex Balan, chief security researcher at BitDefender.\n\nThe \"internet of things\" refers to the growing collection of smart gadgets that can be controlled via the net.\n\n\"Pretty soon everything will be connected one way or another and managed by a smartphone app,\" said Mr Balan. \"You won't be able to avoid it.\"\n\nBut that interconnectivity and ease of use comes at a cost, he said, adding that the end of 2016 had seen a surge in attacks that compromised net-connected CCTV cameras, televisions and media servers.\n\nBitDefender unveiled a new version of its Box router while Arris revealed that it was adding Intel's security software to its devices\n\nThe poor security on these gadgets led to them being enrolled in massive networks by hackers who use them to carry out overwhelming attacks. One network, called Mirai, staged some of the biggest net attacks ever seen.\n\nThe problem has got so serious that the US Federal Trade Commission has kicked off a competition to create tools that consumers can add to their home network that can protect IoT devices from attack. Cash rewards of $25,000 (\u00a320,000) will be given to the best entrants.\n\n\"Security for these devices has to start at the network level,\" said Gareth Lockwood from Symantec. \"There's no other way to do it.\"\n\nAs the entry and exit point for home networks, routers were the best place to put a security system that can watch for malicious traffic coming in and cut off hackers trying to access insecure kit.\n\nThe show floors of the CES tech expo are packed with new internet-connected products for the home\n\nWhile current home routers do have security systems, most are pretty basic, said Mr Lockwood, and none is ready for the explosion of smart devices predicted to be in use soon.\n\n\"If we look forward four to five years from now we expect to see between 20 to 30 billion devices in homes,\" he said. \"There'll be tens of devices per household.\"\n\nRead all our CES coverage at bbc.co.uk/ces2017\n\nThe three companies launching secure routers at CES are taking slightly different approaches to solving the IoT headache though one common feature they share is a smartphone-based management system.\n\nAll three will face competition from established devices such as the Cujo smart firewall and the Home Halo and Eero products as well as from Asus which has teamed up with Trend Micro to put security software on its routers.\n\nThe devices launched at CES will only initially be available in the US but will reach other regions later in 2017. Typically, buying one of the secure routers includes a subscription to a firm's standard security software that runs on desktops, laptops and tablets.\n\nAll three also include net access control systems that let parents decide for how long different gadgets can be used and which sites youngsters can visit. Some, such as the Norton Core, have an internet pause button that cuts off access for everyone in a household.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Tower Hamlets - which includes Canary Wharf - is the most productive part of the UK\n\nProductivity, or more precisely the lack of productivity, is one of the great puzzles of the British economy at the moment.\n\nProductivity growth since the credit crunch has been dreadful and that matters, because unless we make more and work more efficiently we cannot pay ourselves more.\n\nIn an attempt to understand what is going wrong, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) is bringing all its productivity statistics together and conducting new research. It throws up some interesting details and possible explanations about what is going wrong.\n\nOutput per hour worked increased by 0.4% in the three months to September last year, that is an improvement but according to (ONS) economist Richard Heys: \"It is still weak compared to that experienced in the recent past.\"\n\nPart of the reason for low productivity lies in Britain's regions. While London and south-eastern England have productivity well above the national average and equal to the levels seen in rival economies like France and Germany, the rest of the country lags behind.\n\nTower Hamlets, which includes the financial district of Canary Wharf, is the most productive part of the country, a huge 79% more productive than average.\n\nPowys in central Wales is the least productive and, overall, Wales and Northern Ireland have productivity levels 19% below the national average.\n\nThe only towns in the country that have above average productivity are London, Aberdeen (centre of the off-shore oil industry) and Bristol (a high tech and aviation industry hub).\n\nThe Bristol area is one of the most productive in the country\n\nThe least productive city is Sheffield, once home to a huge steel industry but now lagging well behind; Sheffield is 19% less productive than the national average.\n\nThis part of the productivity puzzle is perhaps the best understood. The most productive industry is finance and that is concentrated in London, while many regions suffer from poor infrastructure and communications and have never recovered from the loss of major parts of their economy in previous decades: mining, heavy engineering, ship building and many more.\n\nPerhaps more interesting, is new research by the ONS into the efficiency of family-owned and run manufacturing firms.\n\nThat found well-structured management practices were better among larger businesses, multinationals and family-owned businesses that were not managed by members of the owning families. To put it bluntly the management of family-run firms (which make up more than half of all manufacturing companies) is awful.\n\nEven a small improvement in management would see a huge boost in productivity in such businesses.\n\nAt first sight this might seem strange, but there is a fairly obvious explanation.\n\nWhat are the odds that the best-qualified and most competent person in the world to run a business just happens to be the son or daughter of the current boss?\n\nAs one economist has put it, this is like selecting the children of previous gold medallists to be members of the country's next Olympic team, rather than picking the best athletes.\n\nThere is also the issue of how such companies will attract top staff if they know nepotism means they will never make it to the top, which helps explain why the handling of promotions was one of the issues most associated with productivity.\n\nSolving the productivity gap in the UK will not be an easy job, certainly better regional policies would help, but just convincing family- run firms to appoint competent outsiders to run their business would also have a huge effect.",

            "content": "The FA Cup third round is famous for shocks and surprises - but who will provide them this year?\n\nBBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson has taken a look at all 32 of this weekend's ties and given his verdict on who will make it into round four.\n\nThis week Lawro is up against a trio of YouTubers - Manchester City fan Alex from Blue Moon Rising TV, Tottenham supporter Barnaby from Spurred On and Arsenal fan Reev.\n\nAlex and Barnaby have both got involved in BBC Sport's No Guts, No Glory campaign to share their tales of the magic of the FA Cup while Reev will be behind the scenes of the BBC's coverage of West Ham v Man City on Friday, and posting material on his social media platforms telling his story of the FA Cup on behalf of the Football Association.\n\nAll kick-offs 15:00 GMT unless otherwise stated.\n\nGap = how many league positions separate each team\n\nThis will be a great trip for Plymouth fans and will earn some money for the club too, but I cannot see them causing Liverpool many problems at Anfield.\n\nLiverpool will make a lot of changes and I am expecting to see quite a few young players start for them, but Reds boss Jurgen Klopp will put some experience in there too. Argyle are going well at the top of League Two and he will know he cannot take too many chances.\n\nLiverpool obviously do not want a defeat but they will want to avoid a replay too because that would mean another road trip in what is already an extremely busy month for his side because of both legs of their EFL Cup semi-final.\n\n* Away team to win at home in the replay\n\nCrystal Palace boss Sam Allardyce will shuffle his team and use some fringe players but he will not want the indignity of being beaten at his former club Bolton, where he did so well between 1999 and 2007.\n\nWanderers are playing really well but they have got other things on their mind - they are second in League One and promotion is their priority.\n\nBournemouth will be too strong for Millwall and I am expecting Chelsea versus Peterborough to be pretty one sided in favour of the Premier League leaders.\n\n* Away team to win at home in the replay\n\nReading are third in the Championship and flying. They have showed real resolve at times too, like they did when they came from 2-0 down to beat Bristol City last time out.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Royals boss Jaap Stam's return to Old Trafford goes but, even if Manchester United pick some of their fringe players, I would expect the holders to go through.\n\nStoke and Tottenham should also make pretty comfortable progress but I can see Norwich, Burton and Sheffield Wednesday causing some upsets.\n\nNorwich boss Alex Neil had been under serious pressure but his side beat Derby last time out and he could go from zero to hero if they beat Southampton.\n\nBurton are struggling in the Championship but they fight all the way and I can see them getting past Watford via a replay, as one of my shocks.\n\nI have not been convinced by Middlesbrough at home and Sheffield Wednesday are an attacking team who will cause them plenty of problems.\n\nAs for Preston against Arsenal, can I just pick my own team to win? I would just be happy if we give the Gunners a good game and got a replay. I think we will, because we are extremely competitive.\n\n* Away team to win at home in the replay\n\nI have no idea what kind of teams Manchester City and West Ham will put out but, if both managers field weakened line-ups, I would fancy City to get through. It is the same with Everton against Leicester.\n\nSunderland will be weakened for a different reason, because they have a shortage of fit players but I can see Burnley resting a few, so the Black Cats might just squeak through.\n\nAfter their recent change of managers, it is a different situation for Hull and Swansea, who will both see the importance of winning their tie.\n\nIt will be Tigers boss Marco Silva's first game in charge while Paul Clement will want to build on Swansea's excellent win over Crystal Palace.\n\n* Away team to win at home in the replay\n\nEastleigh had a cracking win over Swindon in round one but, since then, Ronnie Moore has left and Martin Allen has taken charge.\n\nI don't see Allen helping them cause another upset because his old side Brentford play some nice football and score some good goals on their day.\n\nIpswich have not won back-to-back games all season and are not having a great time of things but Mick McCarthy's side never give up the ghost. It might be difficult for them against Lincoln, the National League leaders, but I still think they will get through.\n\n* Away team to win at home in the replay\n\nBrighton are top of the Championship and promotion is the priority for them but I still think they will have too much for MK Dons.\n\nI don't see Huddersfield or Bristol City having too many problems either, but Rotherham are rock bottom of the Championship and Oxford will fancy their chances.\n\n* Away team to win at home in the replay\n\nBirmingham have taken only one point from four league games since Gianfranco Zola took over as manager and I think their poor form will continue against Newcastle in the pick of the all-Championship ties.\n\n* Away team to win at home in the replay\n\nSign up for the 2017 FA People's Cup and take your chance to win tickets to the FA Cup final in May and achieve national five-a-side glory.\n\nI am at Holker Street with Football Focus on Saturday (at 12:00 GMT on BBC One and the BBC Sport website) before Barrow take on Rochdale.\n\nI just wonder if this game comes at the wrong time for Barrow, who had not lost for 23 games since August until they were battered by Gateshead on New Year's Eve, but maybe they had one eye on this tie.\n\nThere will be a fantastic atmosphere because the game is a 4,400 sell-out - Barrow's biggest crowd in 27 years - to see them try to get to the fourth round for the first time in their 116-year history.\n\nIt will not be easy for them, because Rochdale are going well at the top end of League One so even a draw would be a fantastic result for the National League side.\n\nThat would also mean Barrow earn more money from the replay, something I like to see the little clubs get out of the FA Cup.\n\nSutton and AFC Wimbledon are only five miles apart and, as well as it being a derby, Sutton play on a 3G pitch which will be a bit different for the League One side too.\n\nBut, having seen them in their amazing comeback to beat Curzon Ashton in round two, I am backing Wimbledon. They have got some very quick attackers and I think they will have too much for Sutton.\n\n* Away team to win at home in the replay\n\nStourbridge are the lowest ranked team left in the competition, are unbeaten since October and are in the third round for the first time in their 141-year history.\n\nThe Evo-Stik Northern Premier Division side have had a great run but, sadly for them, I think it will end here against a Wycombe side who are in decent form themselves, and have won 10 out of their last 11 games in all competitions.\n\nAt least one League Two team will be in round four which is a good thing.\n\nAccrington lost narrowly when they went to Kenilworth Road in November but their form has slumped in the last few weeks.\n\nThe pressure will be off Stanley on Saturday, however, and I have a feeling they will nick a win, leaving Luton to focus on trying to get promoted.\n\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\n\nLast time out, Lawro got six correct results, including one perfect score from 10 Premier League games, giving him a total of 90 points.\n\nThat was enough to beat comedian Arron Crascall, who managed four correct results with one perfect score for 70 points.\n\nWe are also keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct.",

            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nPep Guardiola's first taste of the FA Cup ended triumphantly as his Manchester City side thrashed Premier League rivals West Ham in the third round.\n\nCity led 3-0 at the break, Yaya Toure starting the rout by firing a debatable penalty into the bottom left corner.\n\nHavard Nordtveit bundled Bacary Sagna's teasing cross into his own net, just 146 seconds before David Silva's composed tap-in.\n\nShortly after the restart, Sergio Aguero cheekily diverted in Toure's shot to become the third-highest goalscorer in City's history.\n\nAnd John Stones headed in his first Blues goal as the visitors comfortably saw the game out in a rapidly emptying London Stadium.\n\nFollowing Friday's opening third-round tie, City are the first team in the pot for Monday's draw, which is live on BBC Two and online at 19:00 GMT.\n\nWatch all the FA Cup goals and read the reaction\n\nGuardiola has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks thanks to a combination of City's faltering form and his tetchy interviews.\n\nBut his team responded with a devastating performance against the hapless Hammers.\n\nWest Ham could not cope with the pace, power and precision of the visitors.\n\nToure whipped in the spot-kick after Pablo Zabaleta fell over Angelo Ogbonna's standing leg before Nordtveit and Silva ensured City scored three first-half goals for the first time under their Spanish manager.\n\nThe Blues were relentless as they condemned West Ham to their heaviest FA Cup home defeat.\n\nFormer Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach Guardiola has regularly been forced into defending his footballing philosophy in recent months but performances like this justify his perseverance.\n\n\"West Ham could not live with their passing, their movement, their one-touch football,\" former England striker Alan Shearer said on Match of the Day.\n\nHammers manager Slaven Bilic claimed ahead of the game that City \"were not that confident anymore\" after Guardiola's methods had been questioned following his team's mixed form in the past couple of months.\n\nHow wrong the Croat was.\n\nBut that, in part, was down to his team's inability - or refusal - to put the away side under any serious pressure when they were in possession.\n\nSign up for the 2017 FA People's Cup and take your chance to win tickets to the FA Cup final and achieve national five-a-side glory.\n\nThe Hammers failed to press the visitors in their own half, allowing Toure - who had more touches and made more passes than anyone else in his 78 minutes on the pitch - to dictate from his holding midfield role.\n\nHowever, it could all have been very different had Sofiane Feghouli not spurned a golden chance to pull the Hammers level at 1-1.\n\nThe Algeria winger - only playing after his red card against Manchester United was rescinded - sidefooted wide of a gaping goal just seconds after Toure's penalty.\n\nAnd that proved the catalyst for the Hammers' collapse.\n\n\"The way West Ham's heads went down is alarming. Alarming for the fans and for the manager. It was embarrassing,\" Shearer added.\n\nThe Hammers have struggled for consistency in front of goal this season, scoring just 23 times in their 20 Premier League matches - four of which were netted against Swansea on Boxing Day.\n\nRegular injuries to Andy Carroll, Diafra Sakho and Andre Ayew have not helped matters, nor has on-loan Juventus forward Simone Zaza's inability to find his feet - or the net - in England.\n\nNo wonder they have targeted an attacker in this transfer window, already having bids turned down for Sunderland's Jermain Defoe and Hull City's Robert Snodgrass.\n\nThis was another toothless performance. And, like the humiliating 5-1 defeat against Arsenal last month, they were worryingly disorganised and open at the back.\n\nWith some home fans leaving after City's third goal and those left at the final whistle jeering his team, could Hammers hero Bilic be starting to come under pressure?\n\nWhat they said\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"We were able to keep the ball more than the last games. We created more chances. Before the penalty we had three or four clear chances. After the second and third goal it was easy in the second half.\n\n\"It's important to win away but it's not easy. I'd like to involve the fans and make them believe we are good. We are the good guys - we run a lot and fight.\"\n\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic: \"The penalty was the turning point because we looked good until then. It was maybe a soft one.\n\n\"We had a great chance to equalise but we didn't. We made mistakes after the goal and started to chase the ball. Quickly it was 3-0 and game over.\n\n\"It's a very bad day for us. It wasn't good enough.\n\n\"What disappointed me the most is that we started to chase them all over the pitch and then conceded two more and it was all over.\"\n\u2022 None The Hammers suffered their worst home defeat in FA Cup history, having never previously lost by a five-goal margin\n\u2022 None Only once have West Ham suffered a bigger FA Cup defeat - 6-0 against Manchester United in January 2003\n\u2022 None Sergio Aguero has been involved in 12 goals in 11 FA Cup appearances for Manchester City (10 goals, two assists)\n\u2022 None West Ham have shipped three or more goals in a game on eight occasions this season - twice as many as they did in the whole of 2015-16\n\u2022 None John Stones scored his first club goal since April 2015 (for Everton against Manchester United in the Premier League)\n\nBack to the Premier League for both clubs next weekend.\n\nWest Ham, who are 13th in the top flight, host London rivals Crystal Palace on Saturday (15:00 GMT), while fourth-placed City go to Everton on Sunday (13:30 GMT).\n\u2022 None Delay over. They are ready to continue.\n\u2022 None Attempt blocked. Nolito (Manchester City) right footed shot from the centre of the box is blocked.\n\u2022 None Attempt saved. Sergio Ag\u00fcero (Manchester City) right footed shot from a difficult angle on the right is saved in the top left corner. Assisted by Nolito.\n\u2022 None Goal! West Ham United 0, Manchester City 5. John Stones (Manchester City) header from the centre of the box to the bottom right corner. Assisted by Nolito with a cross following a corner.\n\u2022 None Delay over.

            "section": "Africa",
            "content": "Mohamed Maouche says he and his wife, Khadidja, were the first ambassadors of the revolution\n\nOne day in late 1958, at the height of the Algerian war of independence, an Algerian couple in their early twenties hopped into a fast car, put on some music and set off on honeymoon from the French capital Paris.\n\nMohamed and Khadidja Maouche spent the next 48 hours on a whirlwind tour. In a MG convertible - painted British racing green - they drove west to Le Havre, then south to Rennes and Bordeaux, east to Nimes, before heading back up north to Troyes and Reims.\n\nMohamed was a footballer and had a letter from his club, Stade de Reims, stating that he was authorised to be on leave so that he could celebrate his marriage.\n\nMohamed and Khadidja were newlyweds - but their honeymoon was an elaborate disguise.\n\nKhadidja secretly recruited Algerian players in France for the liberation movement\n\nIn fact, they were on a covert operation for the independence movement Front de Liberation Nationale (FLN), which four years earlier had started a fight against French rule in Algeria.\n\nTheir secret mission was to persuade Algerian-born footballers to secretly abandon their top-flight French clubs to play for a team set up by FLN.\n\nKhadidja's role was pivotal. She worked with a collective of Paris-based Algerian lawyers who defended FLN activists and at 20 years old, was the FLN's youngest liaison officer in France.\n\n\"I was in charge of contacting the players, either before or during the games,\" Khadidja says.\n\n\"No-one knew I was married to Maouche. They would just be told a FLN activist wanted to speak to them. I would talk to them individually to say: \"It's an order, that's it,\" and they all agreed.\"\n\nThe Algerian couple toured France in this MG convertible as they recruited players for the FLN\n\nMohamed and Khadidja's enterprise was risky. Both had already served time in prison and were under surveillance by the French intelligence services. Khadidja was also on the target list of La Main Rouge, a shadowy group sponsored by the French state to eliminate FLN members and supporters.\n\nBut Mohamed remembers those days of danger and the \"crazy\" story of the car with affection.\n\n\"We had to be sure of ourselves. If you weren't sure of yourself there was no point in going on such missions because, in the worst case scenario, this could cost you dearly. So we were very relaxed.\"\n\nThey drove for 48 hours, practically non-stop, and music was a constant companion.\n\nMohammed Maouche left French club Stade de Reims and joined the FLN team in 1960\n\n\"I loved music so much because it was also a good way to pass the time,\" Mohamed says.\n\n\"There was this one song we used to play. It was by Richard Anthony and it was about a little MG. It was extraordinary. With hair flying in the wind in the open-top car. Oh, we were so young,\" he giggles.\n\nAfter recruiting the players, Khadidja and Mohamed instructed them to slip over the border to Switzerland.\n\nKhadidja was told by the FLN man in charge in Geneva to go to a supermarket called Mi-Gros to collect forged travel documents. As she shopped, she was approached and greeted by a man.\n\n\"He kissed me and while he was kissing me he said \"open your bag!\"\n\nIn went 15 passports, which allowed Khadidja, Mohamed and the footballers to go to Italy and catch a ferry to Tunisia - where the FLN was based.\n\nThere, they joined nine other footballers - three of whom were part of the French 1958 World Cup squad and whose defection earlier in the year struck a real blow to the French establishment.\n\nThe FLN team was ready to kick off and over the next four years until independence in 1962, the players went on tours to countries including Iraq, Vietnam and Hungary to highlight the Algerian struggle for independence. They played attacking, entertaining and winning football before huge crowds of up to 80,000.\n\n\"We were the first ambassadors of the revolution and the Algerian people,\" Mohamed believes.\n\n\"Because most people did not know that there was a real war in Algeria. We spoke to people after the match and the next day there were interviews and that's how they discovered Algeria. We were true ambassadors.\"\n\nLe onze de l'independence, as the FLN team was also known, proved to be a powerful way of winning hearts and minds. Seeing a team of eleven in white shorts and green shirts on the football pitch made an imagined Algeria real.\n\nMohamed Maouche finally joined the FLN team in 1960 and recalls his first match against Libya, which they won 11-0.\n\n\"It was really extraordinary because we lined up and the flags go up\u2026 and when I saw our flag, the national emblem in the air\u2026 with its star and crescent, my heart was racing and I had goosebumps and we all said 'Vive l'Algerie'.\"",

            "section": null,
            "content": "Evidence given by cycling chiefs including Sir Dave Brailsford to a parliamentary select committee has been described as \"extraordinary\" by the chairman of UK Anti-Doping (Ukad).\n\nDavid Kenworthy told the BBC that the answers presented by figures within British Cycling and Team Sky to the Commons' Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee on anti-doping - specifically about a mystery medical package delivered to Sir Bradley Wiggins - were \"very disappointing\".\n\nKenworthy, who is stepping down from his Ukad role soon, also says Russia should be banned from the 2018 Winter Olympics after a report into state-sponsored doping in the country.\n\nHe said the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had made \"a complete muck-up\" by not suspending the entire Russian team from the Rio Games last summer.\n\nUkad has been investigating allegations of wrongdoing in cycling after it emerged that a mystery medical package was delivered to a Team Sky doctor for Wiggins on the final day of the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine, which the Briton won.\n\nIn December, team boss Brailsford told MPs on the select committee he had been informed by former Team Sky medic Dr Richard Freeman that the package contained a legal decongestant called Fluimucil.\n\nBritish Cycling president Bob Howden had told MPs he did not know the identity of the package, delivered by Simon Cope - a coach then employed by the governing body - but that documentary evidence of the medication would be supplied.\n\nBrailsford also suggested that Wiggins' medical records had been provided to Ukad, verifying his explanation.\n\nHowever, Kenworthy - who has been chairman of Ukad since its establishment in 2009 - said: \"There's still no definite answer from anyone who was involved. I still don't know what was in there; I'm no nearer finding out than you are.\n\n\"People could remember a package that was delivered to France, they can remember who asked for it, they can remember the route it took, who delivered it, the times it arrived. The select committee has got expense sheets and travel documents.\n\n\"So everybody can remember this from five years ago, but no-one can remember what was in the package. That strikes me as being extraordinary. It is very disappointing.\"\n\nWhen asked about Brailsford's Fluimucil explanation, Kenworthy said: \"Well that's what Dave Brailsford came out with at the hearing. But actually, if you recall, he didn't say: 'I know that's what it was'. He said: 'I have been told that's what it was'.\n\nCope has previously said he did not know what was in the Jiffy bag he was asked to deliver to France.\n\nWhen asked if British Cycling should have kept records of medication taken abroad by one of its coaches, Kenworthy said: \"One would think so, one would hope so.\n\n\"Here's an individual [Cope] who's carrying a package containing medicine across international boundaries, and he's no idea what's in them.\n\n\"One could say he could be putting himself at risk if they are drugs which one could not properly transport. Someone should be inquisitive enough to say: 'Well what is it I'm actually taking?'\"\n\nKenworthy's comments are likely to increase pressure on Brailsford, who has faced intense scrutiny since his appearance before the select committee, with critics questioning why Team Sky had an innocuous decongestant delivered all the way from their Manchester headquarters to France, when it could have been easily sourced locally.\n\nBrailsford has admitted \"badly\" handling the crisis after providing initial explanations for the delivery to the Daily Mail that later turned out to be wrong.\n\nCommittee chairman Damian Collins MP has said witnesses may be recalled, along with new ones.\n\n\"We're not giving up on this, and we'll dig and delve and find out what was in that package,\" warned Kenworthy.\n\nBritish Cycling say they cannot comment while a UK Anti-Doping investigation is ongoing.\n\nHowever, Team Sky said: \"As we have said from the start, we are confident that there has been no wrongdoing. We are continuing to co-operate fully with Ukad and we look forward to the conclusion of the investigation.\"\n\nWiggins - Britain's most decorated Olympian - has been under scrutiny after he was granted a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) to take powerful anti-inflammatory drug triamcinolone before the 2011 Tour de France, his 2012 Tour win and the 2013 Giro d'Italia.\n\nHis use of the corticosteroid, revealed by Russian computer hackers, had been approved by British authorities and cycling's world governing body, the UCI. There is no suggestion that either he, British Cycling or Team Sky have broken any rules.\n\nWiggins announced his retirement last month, and Kenworthy said: \"One of the tragedies of all this is you've got probably one of the greatest cyclists that the UK has produced, who's just coming to his retirement, and all the talk is not about the successes that he's had, but about this package.\n\n\"It just undermines yet again the joy of sport.\"\n\n'More extraordinary than a James Bond novel'\n\nKenworthy also waded into the debate surrounding the recent Russian doping scandal, saying he was \"absolutely horrified\" by last month's damning Wada independent report by Canadian law professor Richard McLaren into state-sponsored cheating.\n\nThe report alleged that more than 1,000 Russians benefited from a doping cover-up between 2011 and 2015, and that the London Olympics were \"corrupted on an unprecedented scale\".\n\nFollowing an initial report last summer, the IOC refused demands to suspend Russia from the Rio Olympics, but when asked whether the country should now be banned from the next Winter Olympics in 2018, Kenworthy said: \"Yes, I think they should. I think they should have been banned from the Olympics in the summer.\n\n\"The International Paralympic Committee in my view got it right - they banned Russia. I think the IOC made a complete muck-up of it.\n\n\"There was too much politicking going on, that was the problem. People were probably trying to protect vested interests. It's so important that we get this right because we are in danger of losing the confidence of spectators. If they stop going what's the point of having sport. I was lukewarm [about Rio] because I'd seen the Russian thing.\n\n\"It was just extraordinary what was done. It's more extraordinary than a James Bond novel, and it just debases all of sport.\n\n\"We're still getting denials of any wrongdoing and strange statements about whether it was state-sponsored or not - what we now need to do is get Russia back in the fold, and that is taking some considerable time and effort.\"",

            "content": "International Development Secretary Priti Patel announced a review of the girl band's funding last month\n\nA group described as Ethiopia's version of the Spice Girls receives front page billing in the Daily Mail - not for its latest chart-topping single, but for a decision to pull the plug on its funding from Britain's foreign aid budget.\n\nThe paper says the move by ministers is a victory for its campaign to highlight waste in the foreign aid budget at a time when social care is in crisis.\n\nLast month, it reported that the five-piece band, Yegna, had been given a \u00a35.2m grant as part of a three year programme aimed at empowering women in Ethiopia.\n\nThe paper has the headline: \"Aid: NOW they're listening\".\n\nA number of papers lead with the pressures facing the health service in England. The Guardian highlights the warning by the British Red Cross that the NHS is facing a \"humanitarian crisis\" as hospitals and ambulance services struggle to keep up with rising demands.\n\nThe headline in the i is: \"No room at A&E\". It says overflowing casualty departments shut their doors to patients more than 140 times last month, a 68% rise on the same period the previous year.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph says NHS hospitals have been accused of trying to \"spin their way out\" of the growing winter crisis after a leaked memo revealed that managers were being instructed to play down the scale of the problem.\n\nThe paper has seen an NHS memo telling health officials the \"most important thing\" is to avoid language such as \"black alert\" - the phrase used to denote the most serious level of emergency.\n\nSeveral leader writers and commentators take time to reflect on the Brexit negotiations ahead following the resignation of Britain's ambassador to the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers.\n\nSir Ivan resigned from his post on Tuesday\n\nThe Guardian says the new ambassador Sir Tim Barrow faces the daunting task of stopping a tumble towards a disorderly exit.\n\nWhere once the choice seemed to be between hard and soft Brexit, the new worry is of a \"train crash\" Brexit - a scenario in which incompatible negotiating demands from Downing Street and the other 27 countries results in Britain walking away without a deal.\n\nThe Sun urges Britain to enter the negotiations without fearing what it calls the consequences of EU pig-headedness and be prepared to walk away rather than sign a bad deal in haste.\n\nThe Telegraph acknowledges the talks will be a painstaking, detailed task. In the Mail's view, however, Britain has an extremely strong hand as Europe's best market.\n\nThe Express vents its anger at the Scottish First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, for suggesting that a soft Brexit could remove the prospect of Scottish independence for the time being. It says a Brexit without winning back control of our borders, laws, taxes and trading relationships would be a \"fake\" Brexit.\n\nThe Financial Times says Theresa May has had a difficult start to the New Year, with the resignation of Sir Ivan and tensions in government over her management style.\n\nThe Prime Minister gets a mixed review from Saturday's newspapers\n\nThe threat by the Conservative Party donor, Sir Andrew Cook, to withdraw financial support if Mrs May pulls Britain out of the EU's single market, is the main story for the Times.\n\nThe paper says sections of the business world are pressing ministers to pursue a \"soft Brexit\", allowing Britain to have access to the single market in return for some form of payment and a compromise over free movement.\n\nThe Mail takes aim at the Economist for what it calls a sneering hatchet-job in this week's issue, in which it accused the Prime Minister of indecision and muddle. The newspaper urges her to ignore the carping and get on with the job.\n\nWith a 17 point lead in the polls, it says, she has the country firmly on her side, and the prize is huge.\n\nThat prize, the Telegraph agrees, is going down in history as one of our great prime ministers if she can pull off a successful Brexit and begin to rebuild the UK's domestic institutions.\n\nThe Guardian pays tribute to Michelle Obama, following her final speech yesterday as America's First Lady before President Obama leaves office. It describes her as the most inspirational First Lady since Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nLike Mrs Roosevelt, she has proved to be not an old-fashioned helpmeet nor an ornament, but a powerful advocate of equality in her own right, the paper says.\n\nIt recalls that Mrs Obama was born into a black working-class family that encouraged and expected her to excel, amid the deep racism of 1960s Chicago. Those experiences, it says, have given her both a deep sense of what is wrong with America and of what people are capable of achieving.\n\nThe Express leads with research suggesting that an hour's snooze after lunch is good for your health. American scientists believe it can prevent your brain from ageing and help you perform better in memory tests.\n\nSiestas are good for you, but they cannot be any longer than 60 minutes, according to researchers\n\nThey examined 3,000 adults over the age of 65 and found that those who slept in the afternoon were better able to solve simple maths problems and memorise words - and those who didn't, performed badly.\n\nBut the paper warns that the nap has to be for 60 minutes. A longer or shorter siesta won't have the same effect.\n\nFinally, forget about camping, or glamping. The Times reports that more and more people are choosing to spend their weekend breaks \"champing\" - camping in churches.\n\nApparently, the trend grew four-fold last year and the Churches Conservation Trust, which runs the scheme, is raising the number of churches taking part from seven to 12.\n\nThe experience is basic, the paper warns, with no central heating, no showers, and no curtains. But prices start from \u00a319 a night.\n\nA spokeswoman tells the paper: \"We didn't want people to see our churches as museum pieces. Instead, we wanted them to be living, vibrant places.\"",

            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Rugby Union\n\nNewcastle produced a superb late comeback at Kingston Park to stun Bath and condemn the visitors to their third straight Premiership defeat.\n\nThe Falcons trailed 22-10 in the final 10 minutes, but forwards Mark Wilson and Ben Harris both bundled over after relentless pressure.\n\nSecond-half tries from George Ford and two from Semesa Rokoduguni built a lead for Bath before the late drama.\n\nThe much-improved Falcons have now won six Premiership matches this season, one more than the whole of last campaign, and move up to sixth, while Bath stay fourth.\n\nBath looked edgy once again following back-to-back league defeats against fellow play-off chasers Exeter and leaders Wasps.\n\nA torrid first half started with Fiji wing Goneva being given too much space to race in under the posts, followed by England fly-half Ford missing two relatively simple penalties.\n\nFord, who failed to land another crucial penalty and conversion after the break, did start a clinical first 20 minutes of the second half when he strolled in to score as Bath were camped in front of the try-line.\n\nWing Rokoduguni produced two pieces of individual brilliance to help stretch Bath's lead to 12 points - first dotting down while being tackled by Goneva and then showing his pace after latching onto the returning Anthony Watson's pass.\n\nBut the visitors could not hold onto the advantage as big flanker Wilson was pushed over and replacement prop Harris touched down in almost identical circumstances, with Joel Hodgson coolly converting both.\n\nNewcastle director of rugby Dean Richards: \"The boys had belief and really stuck at it.\n\n\"We went 12 points down and just went for it. They showed a lot of courage to do that and come back against a side like Bath.\n\n\"The crowd were outstanding, especially that last five minutes, the players came in afterwards and said the crowd carried them through.\"\n\nBath director of rugby Todd Blackadder: \"I'm very disappointed that we couldn't close out the game.\n\n\"We had a terrible first half. We were lucky we came away with anything at half-time.\n\n\"We didn't do the basics very well under pressure and that's not acceptable. The last two games we've had control and let it slip and it's just not good enough.\"\n\nFor the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter.",
