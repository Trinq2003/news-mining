            "content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nSir Elton John described Graham Taylor as \"like a brother to me\" following the former England manager's death at 72.\n\nSir Elton appointed Taylor as Watford manager in 1977, a year after the singer took ownership of the club.\n\nWithin five years, Taylor took the Hornets from the old Fourth Division to runners-up in the top flight, going on to reach the 1984 FA Cup final.\n\n\"We will cherish Graham and drown our sorrows in the brilliant memories he gave us,\" Sir Elton wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"This is a sad and dark day for Watford. The club and the town. We went on an incredible journey together and it will stay with me forever.\n\n\"I love you Graham. I will miss you very much.\"\n\u2022 None Listen again to a 5 live special: Tributes to Graham Taylor\n\u2022 None Archive: Taylor told me to stick to cricket - Botham\n\nTaylor, who managed England between 1990 and 1993, died on Thursday morning following a suspected heart attack, his family said.\n\nHe was a highly successful club manager who also worked at Lincoln, Wolves and Aston Villa, guiding the latter to second place in the First Division in 1990.\n\nAfter resigning as England boss in 1993 following the team's failure to qualify for the 1994 World Cup, he managed Watford for a further five years, between 1996 and 2001.\n\nHe retired from football in 2003, later becoming a respected BBC pundit.\n\nSir Elton sold his stake in Watford in 1987, the year Taylor left for Villa, but he returned again as chairman in 1997.\n\n\"I am deeply saddened and shocked to hear about Graham's passing. He was like a brother to me,\" he added.\n\n\"He took my beloved Watford from the depths of the lower leagues to uncharted territory and into Europe. We have become a leading English club because of his managerial wisdom and genius.\"\n\u2022 Lincoln City (1972-77) - Youngest person to become an FA coach, at the age of 27 - won Fourth Division title in 1976.\n\u2022 Watford (1977-1987) - Led team from Fourth Division to First Division in five years (W244, D124, L159)\n\u2022 Aston Villa (1987-1990) - Took over when Villa had been relegated to Second Division. Took them back to top flight at his first attempt. Finished runners-up to Liverpool in his third season in charge (W65, D35, L42)\n\u2022 England (1990-1993) - Failed to progress beyond group stage of Euro 92 or qualify for World Cup in 1994 (W18, D13, L7)\n\u2022 Wolves (1994-1995) - Resigned after one full season in charge (W37, D27, L24)\n\u2022 Watford (1996-2001) - Won Division Two title in 1998 and Division One play-off final in 1999 (W104, D80, L91)\n\nWatford will hold a minute's applause in honour of their former manager before Saturday's home Premier League match against Middlesbrough, and their players will wear black armbands.\n\nThey will also organise additional tributes, involving officials and supporters from the club.\n\nThe club say they are \"inviting supporters to tweet their tributes to the club's most successful manager by using the hashtag #thankyouGT\".\n\nThe EFL said a minute's applause will be held before this weekend's fixtures, while clubs will have the option of wearing black armbands.\n\nFootball Association chairman Greg Clarke described Taylor as \"a hugely popular and respected figure in the game\".\n\nHe added: \"He had an exceptional knowledge and a love for the game that never diminished over the years. He will be much missed by us all at Wembley and St George's Park.\"\n\nMatch of the Day host and former England international Gary Lineker said Taylor was \"an outstanding manager, lover of football and thoroughly decent man\".\n\nHe added: \"He made me his England captain and I will be eternally grateful to him for giving me that honour.\"\n\nFormer England striker Alan Shearer, who made his international debut under Taylor in 1992, said he was \"completely shocked\" by the news of Taylor's death, adding he \"held him in the very highest regard\".\n\nPremier League executive chairman Richard Scudamore said: \"You will struggle to find a more decent individual in football, one who cared passionately about all levels and aspects of the English game.\"\n\nHoward Wilkinson, chairman of the League Managers' Association - of which Taylor was the first president, paid tribute to his \"lifelong friend\".\n\n\"I greatly admired Graham for his honesty, tenacity, professionalism and his capacity for innovation, which earned him richly deserved success,\" he said.\n\n\"Football has lost one of its greatest servants and our thoughts and condolences are with his wife Rita, his daughters Joanne and Karen, and the rest of his family.\"\n\nBurnley manager Sean Dyche, who was given his first managerial job by then Watford chairman Taylor, said: \"For such a legend at Watford to be helping you have that chance, and helping me along the way as a young manager, I'm absolutely devastated.\"\n\nFormer England midfielder Paul Gascoigne said Taylor's \"enthusiasm for life and football was incredible\".\n\nProfessional Footballers' Association chairman Gordon Taylor said he had known Graham Taylor since they were both aged 15 at England schoolboy trials.\n\n\"He was a real quality human being. He cared about his fellow pros and the good of the game. He should be remembered as a man who added to the game, who really showed his ability as a manager,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm proud and privileged to have been able to call him a friend.\"",

            "description": "Marine Le Pen is appealing to the French mainstream, but what policies define her as far right?",
            "section": "Europe",
            "content": "Marine Le Pen has been increasingly looking to the centre and left for votes\n\nShe described Britain's vote for Brexit as the most important event since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and Donald Trump's US presidential victory as \"an additional stone in the building of a new world\".\n\nMarine Le Pen, the leader of France's National Front (FN), is fighting to achieve a similar earthquake in France in the presidential elections in 2017.\n\nBut with her increasing appeal to the centre and the left of French politics, how much can she really be characterised as far-right?\n\nMarine Le Pen is the youngest daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, former leader of the FN and a convicted racist, who last year repeated an old anti-Semitic slur that the Nazi gas chambers were \"a detail of history\".\n\nHaving grown up in a political home, accompanying him to meetings from the age of 13, Marine Le Pen was always going to struggle to shake off the far-right label.\n\nBut she did denounce her father's comments in 2015, and effectively expelled him from the party. While her father was leader, the FN was the party that wanted to deport three million foreigners, the party of Holocaust denial and xenophobia. But under Marine Le Pen the FN began to distance itself from such controversial issues.\n\n\"Damned by her father\" - Marine Le Pen managed to get her far-right father off the political stage after his remarks about the Holocaust\n\nSuch efforts at detoxification have proved successful, with polls suggesting support for the FN climbing from 18% in 2010 to about 24% today.\n\nNonetheless, when voters are questioned they still place the FN and Ms Le Pen \"way more to the right than other parties\", says Nonna Mayer, expert in racism and the FN at Sciences Po university.\n\nWhere does she go from here in her pursuit of a detoxified party? The FN has traditionally been a male, blue-collar-dominated party, and the leader needs to target women, says Dr Mayer. So Ms Le Pen has softened her approach to women's rights, and even sees herself as a quasi-feminist.\n\nIn fact, Dr Mayer argues, in many respects Ms Le Pen is more socially liberal than much of the mainstream right - something that has caused divisions within her own party.\n\nThe 2017 National Front manifesto renews its commitment to a massive reduction in legal immigration. Ms Le Pen argues French citizenship should be \"either inherited or merited\". As for illegal immigrants, they \"have no reason to stay in France, these people broke the law the minute they set foot on French soil\".\n\nBut if that is a far-right stance, it is not very different from that of centre-right candidate Francois Fillon - who when first elected as the Republican candidate enjoyed a small advantage over Ms Le Pen in polls but has since been damaged by claims of improper use of state funds.\n\n\"We've got to reduce immigration to its strict minimum,\" he says.\n\nIn a world where the centre is shifting to the right, and the right is shifting to the centre, the lines are getting blurred.\n\nThe two are now competing for some of the same voters. While Mr Fillon is regarded as appealing more to the \"respectable\" middle classes, Marine Le Pen is claiming to speak for \"all people\", and increasingly appealing to a wider electorate, even Muslim voters in the French suburbs.\n\nMarine Le Pen increasingly claims to speak \"in the name of the people\"\n\nHowever, in December she upped the ante by announcing that she would end free education for the children of undocumented immigrants, though this did not appear as a pledge in the party's manifesto.\n\n\"If you come to our country, don't expect to be taken care of, to be looked after, that your children will be educated without charge,\" she said in a speech in Paris. And, more threateningly, \"playtime is over\".\n\nLong before the Paris attacks on 13 November 2015, Marine Le Pen made a link between immigration and militant Islamism. In the immediate aftermath, she proposed to \"expel foreigners who preach hatred on our soil\" and to strip dual-nationality Muslims with extremist views of their French citizenship, a view traditionally associated with the far right.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, those ideas were endorsed both by Socialist Prime Minister Manuel Valls and by President Francois Hollande, before eventually being dropped.\n\nMany of her views have been echoed by Francois Fillon too.\n\nMr Fillon, a devout Catholic, described radical Islam as a \"totalitarianism like the Nazis\". Catholics, Protestants and Jews \"don't denounce the values of the Republic,\" he said, indicating that was not the case with Islam.\n\n\"The clear blue water between the FN and the other parties has been disappearing and disappearing,\" says James Shields, professor of French politics at Aston University.\n\nThe National Front is to the right of the Republicans on law and order issues, says Nonna Mayer.\n\nIts 2017 election manifesto includes upping police numbers and powers and creating 40,000 new prison places.\n\nThere is no mention in this manifesto of the FN's previous pledge to restore the death penalty, an issue that divides the party's core supporters from the mainstream. Polls suggest 60% of FN voters are in favour, compared with 28% of mainstream-right and 11% of left-wing voters.\n\nTreatment of immigrants in France is probably the standout, far-right policy of Marine Le Pen's FN. And it is central to the party's platform.\n\nJobs, welfare, housing, schools, or any area of public provision should go to French nationals before they get to \"foreigners\".\n\nThe centre of gravity of French politics may have shifted to the right. But no other party has adopted favouritism across the social services - and it could breach the law.\n\nMarine Le Pen's niece tweets this: \"Fillon is for the national birth right, for family reunion, against restoration of the borders, against national priority\"\n\n\"She is upholding a policy that not only is thought by constitutional experts to be unconstitutional, but has been judged by the law to be unlawful,\" says Prof Shields.\n\nIn 1998, a National Front mayor, Catherine Megret, tried to implement a new policy that would give a family allowance to French or EU families, but not to other foreign families.\n\n\"Did it stand up in court? No,\" says Prof Shields. But, he says, so-called nativism remains central in Ms Le Pen's platform.\n\nMarine Le Pen appeals to French voters fed up with mainstream politics, but there is nothing far right about that.\n\nIf she wins the presidency in May, she has promised an EU referendum in France within six months of taking office. And the UK's vote to leave the EU in June 2016 has provided the template.\n\nPortraying herself as beyond the establishment, she has championed public services - for non-foreigners - and presented herself as a protector of workers and farmers in the face of \"wild and anarchic globalisation\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\n\"She's managing to get these approval ratings by doing a Trump,\" says Prof Shields.\n\nBut here the lines are blurred too: left-wing parties are playing the anti-establishment, anti-globalisation card as well.\n\nBut what sets her European views apart from the rest of the French right is the company she keeps. The FN has strong ties with the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV), Austria's Freedom Party (FPOe), Belgium's Flemish Interest (VB), Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the Italian Northern League (LN).\n\nThey are all part of the FN-led Europe of Nations and Freedom grouping in the European Parliament and are either right-wing populist or, in the case of the FPOe, far right.\n\nMarine Le Pen associates herself with other right-wing leaders in Europe, for example Geert Wilders of the Dutch PVV\n\nGeert Wilders, of leader of the Dutch PVV, wants to ban the Koran. The Italian Northern League's leader Matteo Salvini is known for his praise of fascist leader Benito Mussolini.\n\nThese views are toxic to the political right in Europe, and many centre-right parties have said they will not form coalitions with them.",

They say Christopher Steele is \"terrified for his safety\", fearing retribution from Moscow.\n\n\"Oh to be a sketchwriter in America\" - declares Quentin Letts in the Mail. \"Mr Trump is a politician, Jim, but not as we know it,\" he writes. \"He doesn't do wriggling and lawyerly evasions. He doesn't do dainty detours or (ridiculous thought) charm. He just comes out and smashes his critics on the nose.\"\n\nSeveral papers highlight what they see as a rift between Theresa May and the head of the NHS in England, Simon Stevens, over funding for the health service and social care.\n\nThe Sun speaks of \"open war with Number 10\" after Mr Stevens fired off what it calls \"a series of barbs\" at the prime minister when he appeared before MPs. The paper calls it an \"unhealthy spat which helps no-one\" - the last thing we need, it says, is the distraction of a row as those at the top pass the buck.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph calls for the politics to be taken out of NHS funding; it argues that there must be a willingness to consider alternative ways of bringing money into the system without it being denounced as \"privatising\" the service.\n\nThe Telegraph reports that Lady Thatcher has taken her place in the pantheon of British greats, in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.\n\nIt says the former prime minister's life story attracts the third longest entry - with more space devoted to her than Sir Winston Churchill. Only Shakespeare and Queen Elizabeth I are given a higher word count.\n\nAccording to the Daily Express, the biography - written by the historian Sir David Cannadine - concludes that: \"There are times when nations may need rough treatment. And for good and for ill, Thatcher gave Britain plenty of it.\"\n\nHenry VIII was well known for his lavish banquets, but now - says the Mirror - it has been revealed just how much he forked out on food and drink.\n\nThe paper reports that his annual bill for meat alone came to \u00a33.5m in today's money - all washed down with \u00a36m worth of beer.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "The claim: Levels of inequality in the UK have been getting worse.\n\nReality Check verdict: Official figures suggest that income distribution has become less unequal over the past decade.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday morning that he would be interested in a cap on earnings, because \"we cannot go on creating worse levels of inequality\".\n\nCoincidentally, Tuesday morning also saw the release of the annual report on income inequality from the Office for National Statistics.\n\nIt said that there had been a gradual decline in income inequality over the past decade.\n\nIt is using the Gini Coefficient, which is a measure of inequality - in this case, a coefficient of zero would mean that all households had the same income while 100 would mean that one household had all the income.\n\nThese figures are for disposable income, which is what you get after you've added benefits and subtracted direct taxes such as income tax and council tax.\n\nThere are caveats around these figures - they are based on surveys, so there is a margin of error, and it is particularly difficult to get survey responses from people at the top of the income distribution.\n\nBut the official figures suggest that there was a considerable increase in inequality in the 1980s, relatively little change from the early 1990s to mid-2000s and then a gradual decline in the past decade, returning the UK to the same level of inequality as was seen in the mid-1980s.\n\nSo from these figures it would be wrong to conclude that inequality has been getting worse.\n\nWhat could be missing from this analysis? The ONS looks at inequality across the whole population - there has also been much interest in comparing the richest 1% or 0.1% with the rest of the population.\n\nThe World Top Incomes Database (which you can see in figure 3 of this blog) suggests that since 1990 there has been relatively little change in the share of income taken by the richest 20% or 10% of the population.\n\nThe richest 1% and the richest 0.1% had seen their share of income rising steadily until the financial crisis, but it has fallen since then. So once again, inequality has not been growing.\n\nThe measures identified so far have been looking at income rather than wealth.\n\nIt is also possible to calculate Gini coefficients for wealth, although the latest official figures for it covered only up to the middle of 2014.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2014, there was a small increase in overall wealth inequality, with property wealth having the biggest effect.\n\nHousing costs are a particular issue - the Department for Work and Pensions calculates a Gini coefficient for income distribution that takes housing costs into account.\n\nThe difference it makes is that inequality increases in 2013-14, although it is still below pre-financial crisis levels.\n\nNone of this suggests that inequality does not exist in the UK or that it is not a problem or indeed that it is not worse than in other countries, but there is little evidence that it has been getting worse in the UK in the past decade.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "section": "Health",
            "content": "Leading nurses say conditions in the National Health Service are the worst they have ever experienced. Below are a selection of the experiences of nurses and former nurses who got in touch to share their experience and the problems they say they face working within the NHS.\n\nI have been a nurse for 30 years, but I am also currently due to undergo surgery, which has been cancelled three times since November 2016, so I feel I really see both sides of the impact of the cuts.\n\nI feel the treatment the NHS is able to offer and the working conditions of staff have both gone markedly downhill since 2008, as the direct result of government cuts to both the services the NHS offers and the number of staff it employs.\n\nI think the responsibility for the problems the NHS is currently facing rest firmly at the government's door.\n\nBoth medical and NHS trust staff are doing the best they can without the resources they desperately need.\n\nThe people I treat are often very ill by the time they reach me, as a result of huge cuts to other departments and services.\n\nThe NHS is at breaking point.\n\nI'm 24 years old, and I've been a nurse for two years.\n\nI should be at the start of a long and wonderful career, which was my dream for many years.\n\nHowever, I am so overworked I can't continue.\n\nI am a front-line nurse on a ward, and the other day I started work at 07:00 and left at 23:30, with only a total of 45 minutes break all day.\n\nWith an ageing nursing workforce, I'm really concerned, because if I can't do it as a 24-year-old, then I really worry about the nurses coming up for retirement.\n\nI worked full-time for over a year at a hospital in Birmingham.\n\nHowever, I recently left because the staffing compared to patient dependency (that means how poorly they are) was so bad it scared me enough to leave.\n\nWe frequently had one junior nurse in charge of the ward, and very often had one nurse take care of four high-dependency patients (patients that need one nurse between two of them).\n\nWe had to leave all admissions until the nightshift because there was no time in the day, which meant patients often being moved on to the ward as late as 03:00.\n\nBasic nursing care was often missed due to the lack of staffing, and resources and training were almost always cancelled due to lack of staff on the ward.\n\nAnd this was not a one-off, this was all the way through the hospital, all the time.\n\nI have worked in a busy hospital in Plymouth for nearly 10 years.\n\nI have watched and listened in despair at people haranguing the NHS and what we aren't doing, but the problem is not the hospitals.\n\nThe problem is bed-blocking because of a lack of other places for patients to go.\n\nAnd that can only be addressed by the social services system.\n\nWe outsource all our social care to independent companies that ask enormous amounts for the elderly and disabled, and this is not realistic.\n\nOne of my patients some weeks ago, had been stuck on our ward for months because a suitable next step couldn't be found for him.\n\nWe need to empty our beds of people who need longer term social care, so we can treat those who are sick and then have somewhere for them to go on to after initial treatment.\n\nWe need more viable old-age homes, and more mental health facilities, because care in the community does not always work and people often simply end up back in hospital.\n\nI was a nurse manager for many years, and I believe the root of the problem for the NHS is the year-on-year cost cutting forced on every single department by successive governments.\n\nWhilst the government puts money into areas such as accident and emergency, it is constantly taken out again by the annual cost-cutting.\n\nThe prime minister has spoken about improving access to mental health services for young people.\n\nWhen I started working in management, in Cumbria, 20 years ago, there were services for young people close to home.\n\nThere were also more beds for adult mental health patients, but annual cost-saving meant wards were closed and beds disappeared in West Cumbria, meaning that service users were admitted to Carlisle or further afield.\n\nThis meant a minimum of an 80-mile round trip for families in an area of the country where public transport is often very poor.\n\nMaybe if the government stopped the annual cuts to budgets and bolstered the system with adequate funds, the NHS would have a chance of surviving and delivering the quality service that its staff want to deliver.",

            "section": "The Papers",
            "content": "Christopher Steele is believed to have left his home this week\n\nMany of the papers lead on the former MI6 officer named as the man who compiled the damaging dossier on Donald Trump leaked earlier this week.\n\nAccording to the Telegraph, Britain has been dragged into the row over the dossier after it was claimed that the government gave the FBI permission to speak to Christopher Steele. It says Britain now finds itself caught in the crossfire of accusations between Russia and the US.\n\nThe Mail says Russia's relations with Britain have gone into the deep freeze as Moscow blamed MI6 for the dossier. The paper quotes a tweet from the Russian embassy in London suggesting Mr Steele was still working for MI6 and \"briefing both ways\" against Mr Trump and Moscow.\n\nThe Mirror's front page has a picture of a two-year-old boy lying on two chairs put together as a makeshift bed at a hospital in Hastings in East Sussex due to a lack of proper beds.\n\nIt says Jack Harwood - who had suspected meningitis - waited for five hours in A&E with his mother, as staff struggled to cope with the volume of patients. His case was put to Theresa May by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.\n\nThe boy was eventually sent home after his temperature was brought down and his relieved parents were told he didn't have meningitis.\n\nThe new King of Rwanda has been proclaimed - and he lives in a terrace house on an estate in Greater Manchester.\n\nThe Guardian says it's not a typical royal residence - but the Rwandan royal family has been exiled since 1961.\n\nThe Daily Mail says Emmanuel Bushayija is thought to be the first Briton to accede as a king since George the Sixth inherited the throne following the abdication crisis in 1936. It seems Mr Bushayija has been keeping a low profile since his elevation, but neighbours tell the paper he's a lovely man and it's a great honour to live next to him.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, the Sun portrayed Graham Taylor - then England football manager - as a turnip after the national team were knocked out during the group stages of Euro 92.\n\nFollowing his death - announced yesterday - it pays tribute to him in its leader column. While it acknowledges his failings as manager, it highlights his successes at club level, describing him as a genius. He had a magnificent football brain and made a fine radio pundit, it adds. Above all - it goes on - he was just a thoroughly decent bloke.\n\nFinally, you could save yourself as much as nine thousand pounds on a house purchase - if you don't mind living at number 13. Research by the property website, Zoopla - released to coincide with today's date, Friday the 13th - found that nearly a third of homebuyers are less likely to buy a property with this number.\n\nBut - the Mail reports - those who are not put off by it will find a house with this number typically cheaper than the average UK property. On the other hand, the most expensive door number tends to be number one - and Number 100 the next most expensive.",

There are no known pictures of his meeting with officials from San Escobar.\n\nDo you know the way to San Escobar?\n\nProbably not, it doesn't exist, but that didn't stop Poland's foreign minister claiming to have had a productive meeting with its officials this week.\n\nWitold Waszczykowski told reporters he met with various nations for Poland's bid to join the UN security council, \"such as Belize or San Escobar\".\n\nMr Waszczykowski has been roundly mocked on Twitter, the one place San Escobar does now exist, flag and all.\n\nHe said that he had had meetings with officials from nearly 20 countries, including some Caribbean nations \"for the first time in the history of our diplomacy. For example with countries such as Belize or San Escobar\".\n\nHe put the slip down to tiredness. \"Unfortunately after 22 hours in planes and several connecting flights you can make a slip of the tongue,\" he said.\n\nHe said he had in mind Saint Kitts and Nevis, a two-island Caribbean country known in Spanish as San Cristobal y Nieves.\n\nTwitter users responded in customary style, creating an official account and a flag for the island nation.\n\nOne tweet said that San Escobar \"fully supports Poland's candidacy to the Security Council\".\n\nAnother designed some currency, but added: \"It's funny until you realise your only allies left are Belarus, Hungary and an imaginary nation state.\"",
